EffOne Toggle navigation Home About Us Overview Vision Careers History Services Our Services Overview DevOps Software Development Robotic Process Automation Software Quality Assurance Application Integration ERP Implementation Staff Augmentation Creative Services Showcase Vertical Industries Contact Us RICH HISTORY OF SUCCESSES IN DEVELOPING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS History EffOne has a rich history of successes in developing software products. In 1990, after 7 years of experience in the software industry, the EffOne core team ventured into developing a process control application from ground up, typically known as SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition). This has varied applications in real-time, mission-critical environments, such as Power Plants, Power Grids, Utilities, Engineering industries or any application that requires data acquisition, monitoring and control. Our first implementation was deployed in 1993 in a regional power grid, load dispatch center. This implementation was so well done that it attracted buy-out bids from multi-national corporations. Eventually, the company was spun off and the core team moved on to web development. Members of this core team had experience in online applications, well before the web as we know today existed. So, it was a natural transition in to web development, with our first website built in 1995 for a local ISP in Troy, Michigan. From those early successes, with already a decade of experience in building robust applications, EffOne was formed in to a custom software development house. Ever since, it has been a successful journey, with many satisfied customers along the way. Over the last 2 decades, EffOne has evolved in to a full-fledged, IT consulting services company, providing end to end solutions. about Vision Careers History Our Services DevOps Software Development Software Quality Assurance Application integration ERP implementation Staff Augmentation Creative Services Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Copyright 1996-2025.
