Despite intense competition from leading Indian B-schools and a general slowdown in this segment, we have received good number of applications across all our programmes last year. This includes our two new AICTE approved full-time programmes, the Fellowship Programme in Management (FPM) and the Post Graduate Diploma in Management (Executive), which have helped make our portfolio more diverse. The rich pool of applicants represented 24 states of the country and this offered us an opportunity to further enhance the classroom experience through diversity. The admission process at FORE School of Management, New Delhi is highly competitive, rigorous, and transparent. All the students were selected purely on the basis of merit, while taking into consideration their scores in the competitive entrance examination, work experience, academic performance, and personal interview performance. Besides merit, there is also focus on diversity in terms of region, gender, academic background and work experience. As with every year, the selection process uses feedback from the past years’ experience to bring about continuous improvements in the selection process.

I wish to thank you for showing interest in FORE School of Management, New Delhi.

At FSM, students are expected to have an enriching and life-turning experience which will enable them to reach new heights in their professional life. We foster sharpening of skills and enhancement of knowledge base in our students through various extra-curricular, co-curricular and curricular activities through faculty who not only keep themselves at par with the current developments but also contribute to the expansion of the body of knowledge in their field of expertise. To facilitate this, we have Centers of Excellence to enhance domain specific research and training among members of faculty and entrepreneurship among students. With very congenial and professional environment our faculty makes substantial contribution to the academia through quality teaching, publications, seminars, conferences, etc. The faculty contribution has received recognition by way of various collaborations we have with our partner institutions and universities in India and abroad, and the excellent goodwill we enjoy with the corporate world who generously contribute to our various academic processes. The corporate interactions including corporate supported projects undertaken by our students under faculty supervision is considered ‘unique’, in the sense, that it provides a close hands-on-experience to our students as part of our curriculum.
