Had Einstein not been suspicious, people would not be so well acquainted with the soul force of this planet. Had humans kept on ignoring the unique and yet mystifying qualities of their surroundings, which they actually did for a long time, they would have never discovered the logic of life, of fire, of air, of water and of the ground on which they stood and passed the incredibly beautiful and sustaining, sophisticated and intricately organised architecture of their habitats as magic for decades, even centuries.Curiosity might kill the cat, but it very much possesses the capability to enhance the experience of life for a human. This curiosity, this constant nag that keeps asking for more, more details, more information and more logic to connect the dots, this thirst to find out why and how something happens can be quenched by the services of only one tool known to mankind: Research.For those who find their calling in the fields of Digital Marketing, Media and Advertising, Public Relations, Electronic Commerce, Journalism, Creative communication and/or Sales and Production, IMCI brings to them, a chance to turn stones, snoop around with a license and dig dirt on whatever ticks their intellectual bones.IMCI, Institute of Marketing Communications India, has always believed in equipping people with tools which may help them in gaining a perception.
