Mobile App Development FAQ’s: Which is better between cross-platform apps and native apps? It is not so simple and easy to choose between native and cross-platform applications. It depends on which is better for your business requirements. Cross-platform applications are compatible with multiple platforms, but native applications are created specifically for a particular single platform. Native apps are great in terms of user experience and performance, which is enough to make the app winner. However, do not forget that the choice depends only on your mobile app. Simple apps like content distribution apps, games, etc., are developed generally as a cross-platform app with some specific native features. Cross-platform apps are chosen or B2B apps where deployment duration is crucial. Many startups prefer cross-platforms as it cost less compared to native. However, compromising user experience and better performance for the sake of savings is often negative. Which technologies are used for mobile app development? To attract the attention of users and make your app usable, you need to come up with an app that has a trending, user-friendly interface and is compatible with the current digitization bar. To do so, one must have a thorough knowledge of the technologies that will help build a robust app. The following are the top 7 most widely used technologies ​​for creating mobile apps: Swift Flutter Python Java React Native Kotlin R Programming Is it possible to connect the existing CRM or website to the mobile app? The mobile app development process can take 3-9 months (on average) to design and develop, based on the structure of the project and complexity of the application. Each step in the process takes a different time to wrap, but below these can take longer: Project Brief Writing: 1-2 weeks Ideas researching with developers: 4-5weeks Design sprints: 6-12 weeks Development and prototype: 6-12 weeks App deployment: around 2 weeks Post-launch support and maintenance: Ongoing. Do FuGenX develop on-demand mobile apps? Yes, being the mobile app development company in India, USA, and UAE, FuGeX technologies can develop on-demand mobile apps. The professional and expert team provides services such as cross-platform application development, native application development, web development, UX/UI design services, etc. They are set to work on a variety of innovation stocks such as Xamarin, iOS, AngularJS, Android, Java, Phone Gap, etc. Is it possible to later modify and update an application? Yes. It is possible to later modify and update a mobile app. However, this process can sometimes be tricky depending on the type of application, security details involved, the features it has, and the information the application processes. What about the copyright of source code? Copyright protects a specific explicit expression of an idea. In the case of software, copyright can protect source code, object code, and user interfaces. Copyright is automatically obtained when the source code is written, the UI is created, or the program is compiled at the time the expression is developed. How to check on the progress of app development? App development progress tracking is depends on how your company actually handles the development process. If you use agile method, there are rituals such as iterations and stand-up meetings that can help you track the progress of team. As App development is a tough discipline, it is very difficult to say how much work will actually be done, and very often the last 30% of work will take 70% of the time. Why should I select FuGenX as a mobile app development company? FuGenX Technologies is at the forefront of offering the reliable, unique and the best features-packed mobile applications for various businesses. The company has a highly experienced and skilled team of developers who develop robust apps using the latest and advanced technologies. It has delivered 1000+ successful projects worldwide and has received many accolades from clients. FuGenX has been crowned with several Global Technology Awards, including Fast 50 India and Deloitte Technology Fast 500 Asia Pacific for pioneering high-quality products in the mobile space How much does it cost to build a mobile or web app? Below are some of the major components that affect web app or mobile app development cost: The scope of the project Business niche Basic and advanced features of app UI/UX design Non-functional requirements App Development company Engagement model How to hire a dedicated team or developer for my mobile project? Before looking for the best app development company, first, you should understand your business app requirements and preferences. Then, check the portfolio and other relevant information about the company take their clients’ opinion, evaluate the individual or team developers’ ideas regarding the project, assess the total SDLC, including maintenance and support steps. Find a reliable and trusted partner who agrees to deliver your project on time, within the budget and long-term commitment. Will I be able to change any developer/team, if I am not satisfied with it? If you encounter any difficulties with any application development team and not being satisfied with the product, you can switch to another development company even in the middle of the app project. But, it’s better to think twice and choose the best mobile app development company FuGenx for your app in the first attempt itself. What are the different types of mobile app development? Mobile apps are majorly classified into three types: Native apps: These apps are developed for a single specific platform, whether it’s android, iOS or Windows phone. Hybrid apps: Hybrid apps are a mix of both web and native apps. This type of apps has cross-platform compatibility but can also access the mobile’s hardware. Web apps: Web applications are the most responsive versions of websites that can work on any operating system or mobile device as they are distributed using a mobile browser. Can mobile apps be developed using Python? Yes. Python is an open-source programming language, which is great for creating web and mobile apps. The process of Python scripting is so smooth and it runs on multiple platforms. What is the process of developing a web app? Following are the five important steps in the web design process that makes you understand how a reliable and unique website is designed. Step 1: Project planning: Sitemap and wireframe creation Step 2: Designing page layouts and approval cycle Step 3: Writing content and assembly Step 4: Writing Code Step 5: Website testing and deployment Step 6: Supporting and maintaining website with regular updates Mobile Development Team or Single Developer, What is the best choice? It is a good idea to choose a mobile app development team to make your business app compared to single developer. This is because the best development team includes project manager, app developers, UI / UX designers, quality analyst, app tester, content writer, etc. that helps build a robust application. Additionally, developing a mobile app takes less time and effort if you hire a mobile development team rather than a single developer. I believe team work is the key for app success. Which is the best mobile cross-platform development between React Native, Xamarin and Flutter? React Native is the most popular cross-platform for mobile game development due to its ease and simplicity. What is the best cross-platform SDK for mobile game development? Some of the best cross-platform SDK’s for mobile game development are: Unity Game Salad Cocos2D-x Corono Labs Lumberyard Do you develop mobile app for all platforms? Yes, we create mobile apps for all major app development platforms available in the market, such as Android, iOS, windows, etc. What is the Quality Control Methodology which you have in place? FuGenX follows a robust procedure to ensure the highest quality. Our team has a dedicated section for QC and QA that ensures that each project is scanned by them. Covering all kinds of tests, they provide a final ‘OK’ before the final handover and expansion. What's the difference between a native and a hybrid application? The native application is used especially for iOS and Android operating systems. The hybrid application contains some native code but also depends on programming languages ​​that can be understood by all operating systems. Hybrid apps are sometimes less expensive and faster to set up for multiple mobile platforms, but native apps generally run faster and smoother. What is best android development framework? Following are the top 4 android development frameworks: Ionic AppsBuilder Corona SDK React Native Recent Projects Designed & DevelopedAl Ansari ExchangeDubai, UAEThe new app has tons of great features, like sending money using QuickSend, multiple payment modes, instant transfer or normal, currency calculator, rate notification, branch locator, navigation, and more refined controls on sending money (to name a few…).

It is definitely a good choice as the market for mobile games is still huge and increasing at a rapid rate. If your game is good and if you market it well, you can make a whole lot of money. You can develop a premium-paid game or a free-to-play game. In case you go for a premium game, you may have to pay 30% to Google or Apple Store and you get to keep the 70% of the price. You can make the app free-to-play for a day or a week and then make it paid. Nevertheless, you have to ensure there are no bugs in your game to avoid any negative reviews. It would do good to hire a few play-testers to make sure the game you develop is very interesting and addictive. While you can charge for premium games and make money, there are ways to make money through free-to-play games too. One of these ways is by introducing in-app purchases. These can include items that the players can buy for their avatar or amount that they may have to pay in order to upgrade themselves to another level. You can keep introducing new items and levels and open new avenues to make money through in-app purchases. Another method of making money through free-to-play games is to use ads. There are many ad networks that will be ready to include their ads in your games. You will get paid whenever a player sees the ad, clicks on the ad or installs the app pertaining to the ad, as the case may be. Nevertheless, it is important to decide how and where you want to integrate the ad in your game in the initial development stage itself. Tangible Benefits You Can Get from Game Development Excellent way to make money Huge market offers a lot of scope for growth Low investment and high returns A tried and tested method to promote your brand 24/7 presence through the app Great way to interact with your customers and build a long-term relationship Although anyone can learn how to develop a game, it is not easy to develop one that is interesting, error-free and successful.
