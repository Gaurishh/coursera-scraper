(Mathematics Education) M.Sc. (Mathematics Education) Objectives of M.Sc. (Mathematics Education) The M.Sc. (Mathematics) is an interdisciplinary program that would prepare students to be competent in various facets of mathematics education, including the nature of mathematics and associated disciplinary values, curriculum development, pedagogy, instructional resources (both hands-on and technology aided), Gen AI, and policy perspectives in an inclusive educational framework. The course will develop essential skill-set and competencies to address the issues in the field of mathematics education, and education at large, and to further explore innovations in mathematics education from multiple perspectives. The program aims to prepare mathematics educators who could address the current educational needs, and can contribute as future ready problem solvers, creative thinkers, and pedagogy innovators. Programme Learning Outcomes Develop greater depth and breadth in mathematical domains most directly related to school and undergraduate mathematics; Understand mathematics education as an academic and research field learning about multiple facets of the field; Develop pedagogical competencies for inclusive classroom practices; Acquire skills to effectively use technology for enhancement of learning; Develop an understanding of curriculum frameworks writing meaningful course content; Develop creative learning resources using ‘Hands-on’ and ‘Minds-on’ approach; Apply design thinking protocols in preparing learning-teaching resources; Develop skills to analyse educational data and infer data driven informed decisions; Develop computational skills for need based solutions to educational challenges; Experience internship programs in schools and educational setting for real time learning; Develop an understanding of multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary approaches to mathematics learning; Develop an understanding of game design that can be used for learning mathematics. Develop an understanding of various research paradigms to conduct impactful educational research; Develop skills to disseminate learning to various stakeholders and to contribute meaningfully in educational and allied field. The program course structure has a fine balance of foundation courses, elective courses and skill-based courses. The course design is field intensive and provides opportunities for hand-on experiences through internships, projects, practical/practicum and research. Objectives also includes:- To move away from the conventional pedagogy of teaching mathematics especially at school level and to include methods of facilitating learning such as storytelling, projects, group work and participative learning. To use technology as significant aid in learning. To impart knowledge of some basic concepts and principles of the discipline. To establish inter-disciplinarity between mathematics and other subjects from Humanities and the Social Sciences. To encourage collaborative learning through group activities and hands-on learning. To provide in-service training for schoolteachers. To learn to apply mathematics to real life situations and help in problem solving. Scope of the course M. Sc.
