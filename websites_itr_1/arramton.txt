Witness the journey of a visionary who turned every struggle into strength.GritGrowthGloryThis is not just the story of a man—it’s the legacy of determination, resilience, and unmatched dedication. Witness the journey of a visionary who turned every struggle into strength. Mr. G.S MarwahMr. G.S. Marwah is the cornerstone of Arramton Infotech—a name that echoes discipline, courage, and visionary leadership. His life journey, born from modest roots, is a source of motivation for everyone who crosses his path. From the days of collecting scrap and stitched dreams, to building a legacy rooted in ethics and entrepreneurship—his story is one of true inspiration. Born in a family where every penny mattered, Mr. Marwah’s journey began in the lanes of struggle. While his mother stitched clothes and his father sold lottery tickets, he dreamt of making it big. At just 11, he began selling lottery tickets to school teachers and neighbors, depositing every rupee he earned. These early experiences taught him salesmanship, money management, and the power of relationships—skills that would become pillars of his future.His thirst for learning matched his desire to earn. In 1980, he joined the Indian Scout & St. John Ambulance Association through school, gaining recognition for his excellence in service and earning accolades. While many children were busy with books or games, a young Marwah hustled with clarity beyond his years. He washed taxis at New Delhi Railway Station and brought passengers for commissions. At 13, he tapped into India’s import restrictions by buying cameras, crystals, clothes, perfumes, and watches from departing American and Russian tourists—and reselling them in the market. This wasn’t just trade—it was international exposure. His ability to interact with foreigners, identify market gaps, and create profitable solutions gave him a unique edge. These years sharpened his entrepreneurial instincts and laid the groundwork for the empire he would one day build. In November 1982, India hosted the Asian Games. Mr. Marwah, only 14, was selected as a first-aid volunteer through St. John Ambulance. His commitment and first-aid skills supported many international athletes during the event. But that same year, life tested him with unimaginable intensity. While trying to stop robbers attacking a supplier of his father’s, Mr. Marwah and his father confronted the criminals. In the scuffle, he was shot in the head. Yet his bravery helped subdue the attackers and bring them to justice. This act didn’t just change his life—it earned him national recognition for unmatched courage, humanity, and fearless action.Honored by the Nation (1982–1985)Mr. Marwah’s courage, resilience, and relentless service to society were recognized with some of India’s most prestigious civilian honors. 1985 - NATIONAL GALLANTRY AWARD Presented by Hon’ble Prime Minister of IndiaMr. Rajiv GandhiOne of the most esteemed recognitions a civilian can receive in India, the National Gallantry Award was bestowed upon Mr. G.S. Marwah in acknowledgment of his heroic act during a robbery, where he was shot in the head while protecting a man from armed criminals. His exceptional bravery at such a young age captured national attention. As an awardee, Mr. Marwah was invited to a prestigious reception hosted by the President of India and took part in the Republic Day Parade at Rajpath, New Delhi—an extraordinary honor reserved for individuals who have displayed acts of courage that inspire the nation. This recognition was not just a medal on his chest—it was a symbol of the strength of character, courage in action, and a spirit that refuses to surrender, even in the face of death. 1985 - Rashtrapati Scout Award presented by Hon'ble President of IndiaMr. Giani Zail SinghThe Rashtrapati Scout Award, the highest recognition for a Scout in India, is only presented to individuals who have demonstrated exemplary discipline, leadership, and service. Mr. Marwah, already an active member of the Indian Scouts and St. John Ambulance Association, fulfilled rigorous requirements to receive this award. He camped with his troop for three consecutive days, constructed shelters such as huts and machans, and earned essential badges in disaster management and first aid. More than a set of achievements, this award acknowledged a mindset rooted in civic responsibility, survival skills, and moral duty. 1985 - Jiv Raksha Medal Presented by Hon'ble Vice President of IndiaMr. Mohammad HidayatullahAwarded to civilians who risk their own lives to save others, the Jeevan Raksha Padak (Jiv Raksha Medal) is a civilian honor that celebrates acts of supreme valor. Mr. Marwah’s intervention during an attempted armed robbery—where he stood between life and death, literally—was recognized as a selfless and heroic act under circumstances that endangered his own life. Shot in the head during the scuffle but still managing to subdue the attackers with his father, his bravery was the embodiment of this award’s spirit. The medal is rarely given, and even rarer at such a young age. His act wasn’t a fleeting moment of courage—it was the outcome of years of training, values. 1984 - Bravery Award Presented by Governor of DelhiMr. Jagmohan MalhotraThe Bravery Award, instituted by the Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW), recognizes children who display exceptional courage. Mr. Marwah’s nomination came from respected local and law enforcement bodies who witnessed or reported his courageous act during the robbery incident. At just 14, while most children are shielded from the harsh realities of the world, he confronted it head-on. His actions aligned with the award’s origin—a tradition born in 1957 when a Scout saved hundreds from a fire, inspiring India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to recognize brave children annually. 1983 - Delhi Police Commendation Class I Presented by Deputy Commissioner of PoliceMr. B.K. SharmaIn recognition of his gallant contribution to assisting the police during the robbery, Mr. Marwah was awarded the Delhi Police Commendation Class I, one of the highest honors offered by the Delhi Police Department. This commendation is generally reserved for individuals who display exceptional service or bravery in non-operational settings. Being awarded at such a young age is extremely rare and signifies the depth of his contribution and the level of respect he earned from law enforcement. 1982 - Asian Games Volunteer Certificate presented by Sports Minister of IndiaMr. Buta SinghAs a certified First-Aid Volunteer under the St. John Ambulance Brigade, Mr. Marwah played a vital role in the 1982 Asian Games, one of Asia’s largest sporting events. He was entrusted with providing emergency medical assistance to athletes and visitors from around the world. Awarded by the Sports Minister of India, this certificate not only marked a moment of national pride but also a testimony to the foundation of service and humanity that would continue to shape Mr. Marwah’s life and legacy. In 1985, at just 17 years old, Mr. G.S. Marwah had already achieved significant recognition while actively contributing to the family’s lottery business alongside his father, Mr. Devinder Singh Marwah. A major turning point arrived in 1987 when all National Award winners were invited to a special get-together by the Indian Council for Child Welfare. Seizing the opportunity, Mr. Marwah, aware of his family’s financial challenges, confidently proposed a request for Delhi Lottery agency rights. His clarity and conviction impressed the organizers, and in 1988, he was officially granted the agency. He continued his education while working relentlessly to grow the business, showing early signs of his determination and entrepreneurial spirit. The bank where Mr. Marwah had deposited his childhood earnings now had staff in high-ranking roles, and these long-standing relationships proved invaluable. Many of them still remembered the hardworking boy who used to save every rupee—now a young businessman managing a state-level operation. These trusted connections helped him navigate the financial and strategic aspects of a growing enterprise. His understanding of banking, combined with an intuitive business sense, positioned him for unprecedented success. With each passing year, his network expanded, and his reputation as a reliable and innovative leader within the lottery sector became firmly established. Mr. Marwah’s progress wasn’t just fast—it was revolutionary. His innovations in the lottery space quickly caught attention far beyond Delhi. Recognizing his rise, Punjab & Sind Bank invited him as Chief Guest for its 84th anniversary event—an extraordinary honor, especially for someone so young. As his influence grew, multiple Indian states offered him agency rights, recognizing his unmatched business acumen. However, in December 1994, everything came to a halt when the Delhi Government abruptly banned all lottery trade. Overnight, the thriving business collapsed. While the industry faced a standstill, Mr. Marwah was left facing a blank slate, but not a defeated spirit. Adversity, however, never deterred him. In 1995, with his signature resilience, Mr. Marwah ventured into new territory—farming. He purchased a large plot of land and began cultivation, soon finding measurable success even in this unfamiliar space. His sharp business instincts remained as active as ever, and simultaneously, he found himself drawn toward the booming automobile sector. This budding interest soon transformed into a bold move. In 1996, he launched Car World, a premium outlet offering everything from car accessories and locksmith solutions to stereos, tires, and seat covers—all curated under one roof. The concept was fresh, and the response, phenomenal. Car World marked the true beginning of his journey into the automobile domain. By 2006, Mr. Marwah introduced advanced automobile locksmith solutions to India, aligning with the rise of immobilizer technology in modern cars. As the Indian auto sector evolved, he kept pace with research-driven innovations. He not only developed high-tech car keys but expanded into solutions for domestic locks, two-wheelers, and more. Through years of hands-on experience, he recognized the widespread disorganization in the locksmith industry. This sparked a new mission—not just to serve customers but to streamline the sector itself. He envisioned a more structured, scalable ecosystem. By 2014, this vision took a tangible form. Leveraging a decade of experience, he transitioned into wholesale, conducting extensive market research that revealed the pressing need for a trusted, tech-backed brand. In 2015, that vision came alive with the launch of KMD, a brand that would redefine industry standards. It wasn’t just a business move—it was a legacy project aimed at educating, empowering, and elevating locksmith professionals across India. Under his leadership, KMD became synonymous with innovation, quality, and service. From humble beginnings to setting national benchmarks, Mr. Marwah’s journey is a story of foresight, perseverance, and purposeful growth.In 2015, we took our first bold step into the automotive locksmith field, unaware that the world of IT was quietly waiting for us. With just a small team and a big vision, we worked tirelessly from a single room, driven by one guiding principle: always be honest with our clients and work in their best interest. Through sheer dedication and round-the-clock efforts, our grassroots marketing approach helped us earn the trust of hundreds of clients, giving rise to the KMD family. Our pitch was simple yet powerful—Best Price, Best Quality, Best Service, and All Goods Under One Roof. This foundation quickly set us apart in the market. By 2016, we were off to a strong start and showcased our brand at Auto Expo – Components, gaining visibility in the automotive sector. However, with rapid growth came operational challenges. Managing thousands of clients manually through Excel, Tally, and WhatsApp became unsustainable. It was then we realized that consistency, scalability, and tech-driven systems were crucial for long-term success. This prompted us to envision a dedicated application and CRM to streamline our processes—but finding the right tech partner marked the beginning of an entirely new journey for us.In 2017, we participated in the Automechanika Expo, where we received a strong response that encouraged us to take our operations to the next level. However, our journey toward finding a reliable tech partner was filled with setbacks. We lost substantial money as some developers took advance payments and disappeared, others delivered subpar work, and a few were unaffordably expensive. Despite these hurdles, our goal was clear—we wanted to scale our business beyond a limited client base and knew that adopting technology was the only way forward. By 2018, technology became our biggest strength and the ultimate differentiator. With a robust app and strong digital marketing strategy in place, our YouTube channel “KMD KEYS” saw exponential growth, converting our traditional business into a smart, automated one. We also hosted the KMD Bumper, a celebratory event that brought the entire KMD family together with prize giveaways like scooters, machines, and cash rewards to boost morale and unity. This year, we rolled out several new products to stay aligned with evolving market trends. Even as we expanded our SKU range, efficient management was never a challenge—our tech partners continually supported us with new features and reports.The year 2019 started on a high note as we participated in the Automechanika Expo and hosted another successful edition of KMD Bumper, featuring even bigger prizes—reflecting the growing strength of our KMD family. Everything seemed smooth until the world was hit by the unforeseen storm of COVID-19. The pandemic disrupted every industry, including ours. The tech company managing our app faced financial difficulties and was on the brink of shutting down, forcing us to make a critical decision. Rather than risk losing years of work and progress, we chose to acquire the company ourselves—an ambitious move that marked the birth of Arramton Infotech. Blending KMD’s brand-building expertise with IT innovation, we entered a new domain focused on transforming businesses through technology and marketing. By 2020, our combined teams had grown significantly, requiring a larger, tech-enabled office space. We expanded within our own building, creating a dedicated floor where KMD and Arramton could operate together. As we stepped into our second year of IT operations, we took on our first new project—Bars of Beauty—a milestone that signaled our readiness to take the market by storm. More projects soon followed, solidifying our position as a tech partner that delivers beyond expectations.At Arramton, we don’t just celebrate how far we’ve come — we’re driven by where we’re headed. With each new challenge, we find opportunities to evolve, adapt, and build smarter, more intuitive solutions for our clients. Our growing team, cross-industry experience, and deep-rooted passion for technology are shaping the way we approach the future. Whether it's crafting platforms that simplify lives, automating legacy systems, or creating smooth digital experiences, our focus remains on meaningful impact. We continuously invest in emerging technologies, foster a culture of learning, and encourage bold thinking at every level. Each project is a chance to reimagine what's possible and push the limits of innovation. We are expanding across industries and borders, strengthening global footprints while staying grounded in our core values of integrity, innovation, and excellence. We believe in a collaborative environment not with just our clients but within our diverse teams as well. The road ahead holds immense possibilities, and we’re committed to walking it hand-in-hand with our clients — building, growing, and succeeding together.Arramton Infotech is a leading web, app, and software development company offering ultimate solutions, from design and development to marketing and scaling.Quick LinksHomeAboutTeamsBlogsContactTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyOur ServicesIOS App DevelopmentAndroid App DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentSoftware DevelopmentDevops ServicesAI ML DevelopmentOTT App DevelopmentIndustriesEducationGroceryEcommerce (Single-Vendor)Ecommerce (Multi-Vendor)On DemandJob PortalFood DeliveryCorporate OfficesIndia - 18 Vaishali, Kohat Enclave, New DelhiUK - Causeway House, 13 The Causeway Teddington, TW11 0JRCopyright 2025  |  Arramton Infotech  |  All Rights Reserved

From humble beginnings to global presence, we've evolved, empowered, and excelled with every step.Who are We?Arramton Infotech is more than a tech company—we are your digital growth partner. From software and app development to marketing innovations, we bring ideas to life through purpose-driven tech solutions.2015In 2015, we took our first step into the automotive locksmith industry, never realizing that technology would soon become our destiny. Starting in a single room with a small team and four promises—best price, best quality, best service, and everything under one roof—we quickly built a loyal KMD customer base. Our honesty, client-first approach, and relentless work ethic laid the foundation for something much bigger.2016With success came the challenge of sustaining momentum. We participated in the Auto Expo - Components and saw our KMD family expand exponentially. Managing increasing client demands manually became a roadblock, prompting us to seek a digital solution. The idea of creating a customized CRM and mobile app began to take root, marking our first serious step toward tech adoption.2017Finding the right tech partner was a tough lesson. From financial losses to unreliable developers, our search tested us at every level. But we didn’t stop. Eventually, we found a dedicated tech team that started building a custom digital system tailored to our needs. This shift toward technology empowered us to scale like never before and paved the path for future innovation.2018Tech became our core strength. Our YouTube channel “KMD KEYS” saw massive growth through digital marketing and automation. We participated in Auto Expo again and hosted the KMD Bumper event to celebrate with our extended family. With new products regularly introduced and supported by tech innovation, managing inventory and operations became seamless.2019We continued growing with the Automechanika Expo and a larger KMD Bumper event. But the COVID-19 crisis disrupted everything. The company managing our app struggled financially, prompting us to acquire it. This pivotal move birthed Arramton Infotech, a merger of KMD’s business intelligence and a full-fledged IT firm dedicated to transforming businesses through technology and marketing.2020As both KMD and Arramton grew, we built a new tech-enabled office space to accommodate our expanding teams. With experience and innovation blending together, our impact skyrocketed. Arramton took off with major projects like Bars of Beauty, showcasing our combined strength in web development, branding, and marketing.2021Arramton’s motto became clear: Your project is our portfolio. With client demand rising, we expanded our team while maintaining timely delivery. Our collaboration with Detailing Street, a franchise-based automotive care business, was a major milestone. We rebuilt their app, created a centralized dashboard, and implemented successful digital marketing strategies that fueled nationwide expansion.2022This year was all about consistency and trust. We were honored to work with the Korean Cultural Centre India for the Korea-India Friendship Quiz 2022. Our website development efforts earned us accolades and another exciting project—Korea Virtual Tour Game. These projects proved our ability to blend technology, culture, and engagement seamlessly.2023With our eyes set on the global stage, Arramton began expanding into the USA, Canada, and New Zealand, establishing local presences for personalized client experiences. Armed with lessons from the past and the power of persistence, we continued to add international clients to our family and new chapters to our growing portfolio.2024As we continued to expand our global presence, 2024 marked a major leap with the establishment of our UK office. This strategic move allowed us to serve our European clients more closely, offering localized solutions with the same Arramton quality and commitment. With our ongoing projects gaining momentum, our UK operations became a hub for innovation and cross-border collaboration.2025The journey forward continues with new horizons in sight. With growing demand from international markets, we are now setting our sights on the Middle East, where we plan to establish our next regional office.
