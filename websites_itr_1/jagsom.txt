The application process is simplified, and every stage of the process includes clear instructions. The collage seeks applicants with a variety of backgrounds and experiences because it encourages diversity. Applications are assessed by the admissions committee using a mix of personal interviews, work experience, extracurricular activities, and academic achievement. The goal of the procedure is to find people who exhibit leadership potential, a dedication to both personal and professional development, and academic excellence. All things considered, JAGSOM's admissions procedure is a reflection of the school's commitment to developing future business leaders who can successfully negotiate the challenges of the global economy.Deepthi Deepu14:51 27 May 24MY EXPERIENCE ON THE ASP DAY.Since every round was held on the same day, the process was first quite lengthy and challenging , but in the end, it was worthwhile. Although I was first anxious, I finally felt comfortable enough to express my opinions to the final interview panel and the batch panel. To put it more clearly, after orientation, I took the JAGMAT exam, which had basic questions on it. Then, with a group of classmates, we had a group activity where we were given time to analyse the paragraph, offer some insightful comments during the discussion of the scene, create a slide, and send it to the recruiter. At last, comes the personal interview rounds one with shoulder batch and the other with faculty. Over all it was a splendid experience, and it was a smash hit. Thrilled to bits to embark my journey as a JAGSOMite. Thankyou.Abhirup Chattaraj06:04 20 May 24Jagsom is one of the top colleges in Bangalore. So talking about my experience in Jagsom is great so far. The curriculum is a bit different from the rest of the B-schools but it's that much effective, it shows how much research has been done to make a framework like that. It provides infrastructure like a library, wifi, gym, playground, TT, Badminton. The hostel is of a class where washrooms are clean, water is RO certified, room cleaning service twice a week & laundry too. The faculty are of top class which makes learning interactive & fun at the same time. Lots of opportunities will come in way when you're in Jagsom like CMT Association competition, working on a project to see how much effective a credit rating patent through analytics can be(as I'm from finance). Talking about the placement students receive all type of support from college.That's my experience in JAGSoMSujay Bhattacherjee08:11 14 May 24Naveen Kumar05:20 06 May 24I am honored to be able to share my experience and write a Google review for my college as a PGDM student in the Business Analytics career track at JAGSoM Bangalore.From the very first day on campus, I was welcomed into a vibrant and diverse community that truly fosters academic excellence and personal growth. The expertise and dedication of the JAGSoM faculty are simply unrivaled. They bring students into a holistic education mix of theoretical knowledge and practical insights. The Business Analytics career track is well-designed and offers hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and techniques in data analytics.The best thing about my experience in JAGSoM has been the focus on experiential learning. From industry projects to mentorship, one is constantly pushed into the implementation of their skills in real-world scenarios—an unparalleled plus that would definitely prepare one for the dynamic business environment.JAGSoM makes provision for infrastructure that is top-notch with respect to the facilities and resources necessary for our learning journey. The learning environment is one that encourages collaboration and innovation and enables one to create a culture of creativity and entrepreneurship.In addition to academics, JAGSoM offers a lot of other opportunities for holistic growth. From the guest lectures provided by industry experts to cultural events and sports competitions, there is always a bushel full of exciting things happening on campus.In conclusion, I am just so grateful for the enriching experience I've had at JAGSoM Bangalore. It has equipped me with the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to excel in this field of business analytics. I wholeheartedly recommend JAGSoM for anyone with a desire to pursue a career in management.Aayush Dwivedi10:52 19 Feb 24Currently (2023), the average placement is going at 13.3 LPA, which is a good return on investment in my view.

You will learn the subcultures of India that you never experienced before. You will make lifelong friends. Friends that will last longer than your college days. They will become your buddies, your advisors when you run into some challenges or crises. And that friendship will begin now.You will be away from your parents. Your parents will miss you more than you will miss your parents, so make sure that when they call you or text you, you respond because they’ll be more anxious than you realize. You will be learning to be independent, and that will increase your self-conﬁdence and self-esteem. Your thinking will immediately be at a global level, you will no longer be thinking about Delhi, or Mumbai or Kolkata or Chennai… Suddenly, you will be part of global citizenship. Most importantly, you will have in the next few years a more holistic development in your life.Learning basically how to empathize with people. And I stress empathy because there are two traits that are very important to human beings: passion and empathy. Passion is an innate characteristic; it is already within you. But empathy can be learned, and you must learn it, because you are from the privileged class, and you need to know what life is like on the other side of the fence.I truly believe this institution will inculcate the attitude of empathy in you because holistic development is the most important part of JAGSoM’s mission. The future belongs to you. And the future for you by 2023-24, and later, is very bright. The whole economy is shifting from low tech to high tech, and you are a part of that generation. So, your career path will be whatever you decide – whether you decide to be a business graduate with a major in Marketing or Finance or Analytics – it does not matter.The opportunities for entrepreneurship will be large, and those opportunities will multiply by the time you graduate, perhaps even while you are still studying, mainly because the infrastructure will be in place, and we will be more and more a Digital Age economy. All of this is great, of course. But at the same time, because you are from the privileged class, you have a responsibility to society. You must do your part and give back to the community. You need to do this for your own self-preservation as well as self-enlightenment. Because simply making money is meaningless and will leave you feeling empty inside.So, you must start giving back to the community right away – you shouldn’t postpone it till you have achieved all your goals and retired. Your time is now! JAGSoM is amongst the select few Business Schools in India with an International Profile: AACSB Accredited & QS Ranked for Marketing, Finance and Analytics programs.
