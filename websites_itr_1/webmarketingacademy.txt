The digital marketing landscape has shifted dramatically,... « Older Entries FAQ’s What is Digital Marketing? In simple words, the Marketing of products and services using digital channels is called Digital Marketing. With time Digital Marketing has evolved and continues to evolve every time we’re introduced to new technology. From digital billboards to television to your smartphones digital marketing has come a long way. With the internet, everything has moved online. People are now accustomed to receiving everything on-demand at their convenience. Moreover, as a business, you’re able to measure everything! and that’s the beauty of Digital Marketing now! Is Digital Marketing important? Why is it preferred over Traditional Marketing? As opposed to traditional marketing digital marketing is measurable, more targeted and result-driven. Thanks to Globalisation and the Internet, we’re able to access information at any time on our phones making the world a smaller place. It’s easier now for businesses to understand and communicate with their customers directly.Moreover, the Ad spends on Digital Marketing is increasing year after year and surpassing the traditional marketing budgets. So if marketing is important for your business you cannot ignore Digital Marketing. How will a course in Digital Marketing help me? If you’re a Fresher and looking to start your career in a fun creative industry where you get to work on social media and digital platforms.If you’re experienced then this course will help add value to your skill-sets and upgrade your career.If you’re looking for a job that gives you the freedom to work from anywhere then Digital Marketing gives you that freedom.If you’re an entrepreneur or planning to be one then Digital Marketing helps your business start and grow.If you’re a creative person and looking for a course/career to help unleash and market your creativity. I have experience in Traditional Marketing. How can Digital Marketing help me? To cite an example, one of our own students, who had an experience of 8 years in traditional marketing quit his job and took up a Digital Marketing course with us.Two months into the course and he had an offer from a Fortune 500 company for 17 lakhs per annum. This is just one of the many examples.We’re not saying that Traditional Marketing is outdated. It can never go out of fashion and Digital Marketing will only enhance your knowledge and understanding and help you do what you do better.Digital Marketing helps you segment your audience and target them much more effectively and helps you measure ROI. And that’s why more and more companies are emphasizing on Digital Marketing expertise. How can this course help me earn online? Earning online is not necessarily as easy, quick and glorious as it is made to look like.It can be a slow long and ongoing process depending on how you decide to earn.There are three ways to earn online:1. Adsense: You can create an Adsense account and get paid by allowing ads on your website.2. Affiliate marketing: Affiliate marketing is the process of earning a commission by promoting other people’s (or company’s) products through your website or other affiliate networks. It works on a revenue sharing basis.3. Influencer: You can become a Social Media influencer by growing your follower or fan base so companies approach you to promote their products. What is the pre-requisite/qualification one requires to pursue this course? There is no predefined requisite or qualification to pursue this course. If you have a basic understanding of the English language and the internet you’re good to get started on the course. I am from a non-marketing background, can I do this course? More than 50% of our students are from a non-marketing background. We have trained students from backgrounds encompassing all fields of science, commerce, and arts. Some are as young as 12th graders and some come with even more than 20 years of experience. What is the better way to learn Digital Marketing - Online or Offline? The mode of learning depends more on the individual and his comfort level. Some people prefer to read and learn, while some like to watch videos and some prefer to learn through practical implementation.That being said gaining expertise in Digital marketing requires practice. We believe that you need to learn the concept, practice it – implement and play with the tools, see the results analyze them, and improve.It requires continuous learning to master the art.And that’s why we offer a classroom training set-up with no more than 8-10 students in a batch ensuring that the sessions are interactive and individual attention can be provided to each student.Apart from this, we make sure students work on live projects after every module so that they get hands-on practical experience and can clarify their doubts because digital marketing cannot be just a theory-based field.All this cannot be possible with online classes, though online classes have their own set of advantages.We personally believe in an interactive and collaborative learning style and would advise the same. What kind of technical knowledge is required for this course? The ability to surf the internet is all you need. All other skill sets you can acquire during or after the course Is it mandatory to have a website in order to learn Digital Marketing? A website is necessary in order to understand the concepts of Digital Marketing and that is why we help students come up with their own website using WordPress. This requires no technical or coding knowledge.Having a website helps you implement the concepts you learn and helps you get hands-on experience.We will also ensure you work on other Live Projects during the course to get more exposure and practical experience. I don’t have a degree, can I do Digital Marketing Course? We have students as young as 17 and students with 15 years of experience and from various backgrounds from dropouts to professionals.

Getting the business ready for the digital age is the most important priority for many organizations today. “Make Digital Strategy as the very essence of your business-growth objective” Before unlocking success in digital-business growth, let’s understand what entails in order to bring about a digital revolution in your organisation Clear Digital-Business Strategy (Purpose): Having a clear and defined digital objective and a strategy is very essential to initiate the transformation process. Digital Tools & Techniques (Process): Enabling the organization with the right tech solutions & tools for effective and efficient execution of the digital strategy. Digital Talent Execution (People): Achieving business growth through next-level execution by digital talent is crucial to sustain the digital strategy and achieve the objectives While organizations today focus on enabling technologies, they miss out on working on a clear digital strategy and enabling their teams for effective execution. While digital transformation will be different for every organization, in the general context, digital transformation is defined as the use of digital technology in key areas of a business resulting in fundamental changes to how organizations function and deliver value. However, beyond the basic understanding of digital transformation, it is the cultural shift that is required by organizations to challenge the present and experiment with the possibilities of new digital practices and walk away from long-standing business processes. “Get ready to embrace a Digital Ready Culture in your organization” Our Story We optimize people’s lives and make them a confident digital marketer We are a Corporate Digital Marketing Training Company located in Bangalore delivering Digital Marketing, Customized Digital Marketing Training across India offline and online We are humbled and proud to touch people’s life and career.

Digital marketing is not something that you can master by watching a video or by reading a book/blog. If you wish to master the art, then You need to understand the concepts, the 4 W’s (what, when, why, where) and how of it. You need to implement, practice, play and experiment to get your hands dirty. You should be ready to fail and learn from your failures to become successful. (A Free eBook Download) Check out a systematic guide to Modern Digital Marketing Moreover, what we believe, the above mentioned is difficult to accomplish through online classes. As most of you would be aware that Web Marketing Academy (WMA) offers Digital marketing courses. Many of you may or may not have visited our academy and you may or may not be familiar with the course curriculum and understand that it covers all the aspects that you need to become a Digital Marketer.

As you go on to read further we will try our best to answer most possible questions you might have in your mind around Digital Marketing & a career in the same space. Also feel free to talk to us (+91-8792299538 or +91- 9731388721) anytime or visit us at your convenience to meet the lovely WMA Family. As mentioned above – ‘WE TOUCH PEOPLE’S LIFE’! This is something very close to our heart & it is what we believe in. We consider this as the foremost and fundamental aim of our Digital marketing journey that we share with everyone who is part of WMA. Have you ever thought how difficult or easy it is to take a career decision & when exactly you need to start planning for it or How much time is actually required to prepare for that decision? Let’s say if you wish to invest in an electronic product/commodity may be a phone or a tablet, how long does it take to research & decide on the final purchase? A couple of days or a week at the max! That’s it. It’s an easy buy, which involves a little bit of your time to research & a small amount of money because the shelf life of such products is small maybe 2-3 years. The same thing applies if you have to buy some apparel, again an easy buy with a shelf life of 6months to 1 year. You might decide in a couple of hours. Now let’s suppose you want to invest in an automobile – 2 wheeler or 4 wheelers with a shelf life of 5-10 years & you want to ensure you put in your hard earned money in the right & the best one. This requires a good amount of time to do the research before the final purchase is made may be 6 months – 1 year, a lot of effort to look at the various options available in the market, analysis of your own requirement, usage, Budget affordability, etc. Your Career Investment is a Lifetime decision: Can you do the same while you have to invest in your career? Absolutely not! Career Investment is a Lifetime decision and will definitely need a lot of time to research & understand if it is something you would want to pursue for your lifetime. Believe it or not, this exercise begins at a very early age. Here’s how: While you were studying in school and specifically when you stepped into the 10th standard, did you go through the pressure of getting good grades in your board exam? And Also get an overall good percentage so you are qualified to be able to choose the specific stream you wish to get into or continue with in future? Because it was your interest or may be forced upon by the parent’s wish, as they want you to become a doctor, engineer, lawyer, etc. So much pressure on the little shoulders! Your grades/ scores and choice of the stream then, was quite important as they laid the foundation stone of our career goal. Agree? …Well, that one decision/ choice, which would further guide you through the path of what you want to become in future. It serves as a base on which we build the domain of our career. It helps us give direction to keep moving further and keep making the right investments in terms of acquiring necessary skills or courses to enhance our knowledge, stay up to date & shape our career. What I am trying to accentuate here is, it takes a lot of time, effort, focus, energy, skill, and dedication for making the right choice, which is almost like a huge lifetime investment. You may want to call it a career insurance that you plan for. Are these some of the questions going through your mind? And if you are thinking along these lines, the below points might help you find answers. If you are thinking about how to get started with a digital marketing career or What are the factors that need to be considered for choosing the right Digital Marketing course? This is how to get started: Research about the industry you want to get into Understand the scope of Digital marketing Digital Marketing Career Scope in India List down the places offering the course Find out the mode of training best suitable for you Does the course cover Digital Marketing Tools, Certification, Challenges, Pros & Cons Analyse what suites you the best Some interesting reads for you: Do I need a degree to do a Digital Marketing Course? Is Digital Marketing a good career? Is Digital marketing good for me? Now Let us explain Why WMA and how we are different from others. As part of our culture at WMA we are very particular about how we conduct training, where students will learn the What, When, Who, Why and how to of Digital marketing. By now if you have referred WMA Course curriculum you would know that we have you covered on all the aspects of Digital Marketing. Moreover, we help make the whole experience worthy of the following value adds: In-person Classroom Environment Set up – boardroom seating style – “Learn from Each other” Everything makes a difference as the seating set up itself is such that it encourages interaction between the batch mates, share ideas, views & jointly work on live projects & activities during the class. This adds up to their interpersonal skills and helps them socialize with everyone. Help to understand the people better as you can see the person, talk face to face, understand body language, facial expression and most importantly the behavior. Let’s not forget, even though we are teaching or learning Digital marketing – at the end of the day, we are dealing with people and their behavior. Also prepares the student for group discussions. When they appear for an interview and when they have a group discussion round, they will be more confident while talking in front of a group of strangers Small Batch Size – “Small makes a huge difference” Our usual batch size is not more than 10 students. It encourages students to open up and also helps them during their assignment presentation Helps in having healthy debate/discussion A post shared by Web Marketing Academy🎓 (@webmarketingacademy) on Mar 2, 2018 at 8:18am PST Live projects – “Experiment / Implement as you learn” Encourage to make mistakes – as part of the curriculum we share some projects with the students for practice purpose only and encourage them to keep making mistakes. Learn from trial and error – the live projects help students to try out everything they learned during the classes & commit mistakes. Learning from the mistakes is something that remains with you forever! To work as a team – this also encourages people to work with each other. These activities help them build their cross-functional capabilities which is the key requirement for corporate companies. Practicing on live projects makes one more confident, become familiar with the interface and get hands-on experience on how and why of it. Personal Attention & Guidance – “We care about you and your career” Because we have small batch size, it helps the faculty also to pay personal attention to each and every student in the batch while teaching the Digital Marketing concepts and assess the understanding level of the student. That is very difficult in an online format. I am sure many of us went to evening tuitions or coaching classes post our regular school or college hours, why? So that the students are clear with concepts & can clarify any kinds of doubts then & there directly which was difficult in a class size of 40-50 students. Encourages healthy relationship between the student and the tutor Events, technical sessions – “Stay updated with Industry updates & trends” At WMA we offer our Students certain opportunities to be part of some events or technical sessions in addition to the regular course classes. This is to help expand knowledge within the field, about the industry and familiarise themselves with latest trends & updates. Networking Opportunity – “Develop Industry Connects and get noticed” We are glad that we have most of our Alumni’s connected with us in some form or the other. And this is a positive sign. WMA’s alumni are quite approachable to talk & learn best practices, etc. Events and sessions: these activities help students network and socialize with people outside & grow their network. Others in the industry – we also encourage that students identify some of the industry influencers to follow, that can help them shape their career path. Assisted Mentorship – “Anytime access to faculty” After the course – Ask anyone and they will tell you how much they like to spend time at WMA even After the course is over and invest time in practicing their learnings. And faculty at WMA love to assist them & are always available to provide 100% support to make them successful. Beyond the subject as well – the reason we always call WMA as WMA Family & not Academy is because we don’t restrict students & faculty’s to limit themselves to conversations around Digital Marketing all the time but talk about other interesting topics they like and exchange ideas, opinions, views such as hobbies, life, sports, family, etc. this helps to realise people’s real potential. Once you are on the job and working with clients and come across specific scenarios and look for assistance – we are just a call away and are more than happy to help you learn on the job. As that is when the real mentorship comes into picture when you are in the actual battlefield fighting and dealing with the client expectations, deliveries and deadlines along with reviews and revenue. Certification assistance – “Master the skill, Get certified” The approach – after each module we encourage students to refer additional resources and how and where to attempt the assessments to get certified. The process – also assist them with exact process around attempting certification assessments and what certification would make sense for every individual. And how we help – by giving them some mock tests and executing a Q&A session and clarify doubts as necessary Placement assistance & opportunities – “Get Placed in your dream job” WMA is also associated with some companies who reach out to us for hiring Digital Marketers, SEO Expert, Content marketing, social media expert, etc. WMA offers assistance & exciting opportunities from some of the employers for you to find your dream job, from the day you join WMA you will be receiving assistance from WMA along with some job vacancy’s till you land a job in hand. Interview assistance – we also assist our students on how to prepare for a digital marketing job interview, do & don’ts to get them ready to face the interviewers. We also assist by sharing some frequently asked questions & how to respond to the interviewer etc. Culture – “We embrace what represents WMA Family” As a part of Social Media Classes, we host Potlucks to bring together the students of other batches as well as to socialize & network. You too are invited anytime to join in. WMA Inter-batch sessions/Activities – to enhance the interpersonal skills Outdoor sessions for Social media classes – to practically practice the features of the platform and post their creation Guest Lectures – “Learn from Experts & gain corporate insights” We bring in external Speakers or SME’s to share with you their Digital journey with resources to follow & how to tips. Expand horizons – they add perspective to the learning basis their corporate experience to help you understand how the corporate world functions by sharing relevant industry insights. Alumni’s Success stories – Connect with Some of our alumni’s who got placed after the course and learn from their experience. Customized crash course – “We care about your professional needs” We do accommodate & customize course curriculum for some organizations and train their workforce. Corporate digital marketing training program – “Add additional Skill to the corporate portfolio” Customized workshops designed for companies who are looking to train their high performing executive, and employees in digital/social/new media marketing Program objectives include – how to build an online strategy, usage of acquisition tools like Search Engine Optimization, Search Advertisement, Google Ad words, affiliate marketing, content marketing, social media, mobile marketing, display advertising, analytics techniques, web analytics, etc. Guidance through advanced digital marketing strategies with a global and local perspective.

Want expert suggestions about your Digital Marketing Career – Call Us on 8792299538 To cite an example of the scope of digital marketing in India – one of our own students, who had 8 years of experience in a traditional Marketing role, quit the job to take our Digital Marketing course. Two months after the course, he had an offer from a Fortune 500 company of 17 lakhs per annum. There are many more examples like this that speak for the limitlessness of the scope of digital marketing and not just in India but the world over. If you look at the job listings on LinkedIn, about 20-25% of the jobs listed are in the Digital Marketing realm. This is no surprise that the scope of digital marketing and the Digital Marketing industry is growing at a fast pace and in need of skilled professionals. The scope of digital marketing is only increasing day by day. Unlike a few years ago, it is a bit of a challenge to stay up to date in the Digital Marketing industry today. It is no longer enough to read a few blogs and the occasional book. This is probably enough to have a superficial knowledge of the industry and is certainly a good starting point. But it is nowhere near enough if you want to become a skilled professional. The industry is so dynamic that by the time a book is published, what is written in it will be outdated. The question is now that I’m aware of the Scope of digital marketing, How do I start a career in Digital Marketing? Here are a few ways to get started in Digital Marketing You don’t have to quit your current career to get started in digital: I had a few participants with more than 5-6 years of experience in traditional marketing. They quit their current job to pursue a career in digital and had to wait a couple of months after taking up the digital marketing management course to get an offer. But they ended up with an offer to double their previous pay. Finding a job that fits you might be challenging, so unless you have to quit to get started don’t quit your current job. Get started while you are still at your job, and spend a few hours a day on digital. We will get into blogs, and websites to follow in a bit. (P.S.: WMA also offers weekend batches.) Start by reading digital marketing blogs: This is the age where with the increasing scope of digital marketing a lot of industry experts maintain their own blogs and websites where they regularly update their ideas and learnings. For example, SEOmoz, http://www.seomoz.org/blog Hubspot http://blog.hubspot.com/, and Avinash Kaushik’s Occam’s Razor http://kaushik.net. These blogs are very rich in information and they’re free. It is a wonderful place to pick up industry insights that you can apply for your job or to your own website. Here is a blog post with links to blogs, and books every marketer should follow: https://www.webmarketingacademy.in/blogs-every-digital-marketer-should-follow/ Attend digital marketing events, webinars, and meetups in your city: There are several meet-ups and hangouts happening in your city similar to this. Attend a few and stick to the ones that you will benefit from the most. If you attend events, webinars, and conferences, you will not just learn from the speakers, but also from your fellow attendees who will be more than willing to exchange experiences. It can be a good place to see how your peers are doing things and how you match them and what you can learn from them. Your Story, Startup Saturday,  Attend these events and network with like-minded people. You will learn a lot from them about the growing scope of digital marketing. Attend conferences related to digital marketing and new media A great way to touch base on the ever-evolving and growing scope of Digital in India. Start your own blog.  (Time to start – 5 minutes) It takes less than five minutes to start a blog on WordPress or Blogger. And update it frequently. Do not worry about who reads it or what impact it makes on someone else. The first person a blog will impact is the author herself. So experience first-hand the scope of digital. Take the Inbound Marketing Certification from Hubspot for Free Hubspot offers them for free and these certifications are widely recognized in the industry. Before you take the exam, read this blog post on how to pass the Inbound marketing certification: https://www.webmarketingacademy.in/inbound-marketing-certification-2013/. I have to say it is not easy to pass, but going through the videos will be extremely useful. Is it worth taking up online digital marketing certification courses? Even though, we are in the digital era, having a one-on-one instructor-led program is valuable and you will learn more in classroom settings, where you can ask questions and practice them. There are plenty of free YouTube videos. But an interactive classroom setup and working on live projects will help get real-time insights into the digital marketing industry and its scope. Digital marketing workshops, webinars, and videos are another great way to get real-time insights into the scope of digital marketing in India. Again there are plenty of workshops conducted in your city. Before attending those workshops, do your research, look at the past workshops, talk to the attendees if possible and see their career, and how it has impacted their career, and then take a call. However, attending webinars and videos like Whiteboard Friday from SEOMoz will add a lot of value and you will learn a lot. http://www.seomoz.org/blog/category/whiteboard-friday and Hubspot conduct weekly webinars on a variety of digital marketing topics, attend those webinars. http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-webinars You can also sign up for Web Marketing Academy’s upcoming workshops on digital marketing. www.webmarketingacademy.in send us an email at [email protected] or call us at 8792299538 What about taking a digital marketing course from the web marketing academy?
