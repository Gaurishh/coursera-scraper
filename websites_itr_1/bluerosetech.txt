In this high flux domain, it has become imperative for service providers to engage with service partners who have sound domain and technology expertise with well defined processes to improve their Operations and Business support systems (OSS/BSS) while simultaneously lowering costs. Communication Service Providers are forced to become experts in rapid experimentation, and that implies having enormous operational dexterity. Telecoms must not only launch services quickly, they must also bill for them creatively and provision them efficiently to keep ahead. At a time when operational systems and OSS/BSS platforms are being stretched to their limits, it’s crucial that revenue leaks, fraud, customer bad debt, and interconnect billing problems don’t sink the business in the midst of the system juggling. Carriers are dealing with competition, new service roll out, pricing pressure and rapid expansion.
