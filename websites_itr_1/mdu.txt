The University, with the passage of time and development of technology and requirement of Society, upgraded the Correspondence Cell to the level of Directorate and expanded tremendously to offer a wide spectrum of courses through a network of Study Centers. ¬†With the amendment in the Maharshi Dayanand University Act in the year 2012, the Directorate restricted delivery of its courses to distance learners from its Headquarters and is providing opportunities for higher education to a large segment of population especially disadvantaged groups living in remote and rural areas, housewives and working people. From 01.04.2022, the name of the Directorate of Distance Education has been changed to Centre for Distance and Online Education. ¬†¬†¬†	The Centre for Distance and Online Education is creating, preserving, and disseminating knowledge to build competitive capability for holistic development of man and society. The various programmes offered by the Centre for Distance and Online Education range from conventional to professional as per needs of the area and employment opportunities available in the country. In order to meet growing demand of open and distance learning, the CDOE has acquired resources for further access to rural areas. The CDOE is contributing significantly towards achieving the national objective of providing quality education to one and all with a motto to reach the unreached by offering useful distance education programmes to learners belonging to different parts of the State/Country. The Centre for Distance and Online Education is offering following popular Undergraduate/Postgraduate programmes through Open and Distance Learning Mode and Online Mode: ¬†¬†Open and Distance Learning Programmes: Bachelor of ArtsBachelor of CommerceMaster of Arts (Hindi)Master of Arts (English)Master of Arts (Sanskrit)Master of Arts (Economics)Master of Arts (Public Administration)Master of Arts (Political Science)Master of Arts (History)Master of Arts (Journalism and Mass Communication)Master of Library and Information SciencesMaster of CommerceMaster of Science (Mathematics) Online Programmes : Bachelor of ArtsMaster of Commerce (M.Com)Master of Science (Mathematics)Master of Arts (Hindi)Master of Arts (Political Science)Master of Arts (History)Master of Arts (Economics)Master of Arts (Public Administration) All the programmes are based on carefully designed curriculum, well planned teaching learning strategies, effective student support system for an effective functioning and fair examination and valuation system. Online counselling has been provided to all the students during COVID-19 Pandemic period and also provided Online learning resources.In addition, the Centre for Distance and Online Education is also taking steps for exploring the possibilities to offer some new Certificate/Diploma programmes through Online mode in accordance with the DEB (UGC) Regulations, 2020. ¬†¬†	The CDOE is providing full support and service to its students, ensuring removal of difficulties at personal level so that the participation of the students in the programmes offered by the CDOE becomes really effective and meaningful. 	The Centre for Distance and Online Education has evolved the concept of ‚ÄúStudents Support Services Camps (SSSCs)‚Äù to help and groom the distance learners in several ways. Student Support Service in open and distance learning system is quite different from other services. These services are not only confined to interactive counselling or solving the learner‚Äôs problems but also include to promote distance learning to address the issue of continuous upgradation of skills so as to produce manpower resources of the kind and the number required by society, to fulfill the expectations indicated in the National Education Policy-2020. In addition to the services already mentioned, the focus of the educators is also on learners‚Äô personality development, inculcating soft-skills, career counselling & guidance and community education. Further, the SSSCs are aimed to facilitate learning, counselling and to solve the problems of the distance learners. Through SSSCs the learners get an opportunity to interact with the counsellors and the peer group.

The IQAC is a nodal agency for ushering in the era of total quality management by working out intervention strategies to enhance overall quality in the institution. Basic purpose of IQAC The IQAC works for ensuring continuous improvement in the entire operations of the institution, and assuring all the stakeholders connected with higher education- namely students, parents, teachers, staff, funding agencies and society in general. The NAAC advocates establishment of IQAC by every institution to make quality enhancement an integral part of institutional functioning. IQAC is utilized to generate good academic ideas and practices. It seeks to work for planning, implementing, and measuring the outcome of academic and administrative performance of the institution. Goals and Objectives The primary aim of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic action to improve the academic and administrative performance of the institution.
