Sana Miriam Joseph II SEM BA JPCS Read More Soul-filling experience Brian Herbert, a famous American author had rightly said “the capacity to learn is a gift, the ability to learn is a skill; and the willingness to learn is a choice”. This was true for the MA students of Journalism and Mass Communication. As we were fortunate enough to learn and teach on February 27, 2018 at Byalahalli, Kolar district, Karnataka.

But, for a shopkeeper who runs the business, that string and what it does is a big deal. I was curious about this practice and so during one of my reporting assignments I stepped out of KJC to find out. I spoke to a shopkeeper J.K Myladi, the owner of a shop in Kothanur.. Anand Prince II MA, JMC Read More Difference between Good cinema and an Empty plot We all have witnessed at least one particular semester during our college days where seminars and conferences may seem way too informative sometimes.

GouriPriya M.S I MA English Literature Read More Flattered by Chapathi My mom and I are truly the impressions of each other. During my childhood I used to think of her as someone who imitates me, but later, I realized that this was not learned, but rather something that was acquired through bloodline.

Alan Kurian I BA JPCs Read More Life of Millennials The term Millennial is used to refer to people who are born from 1980s to late 2000. They are often characterized by their proximity to technology, communication and media. In simple terms, their life is imbibed in technology and purely dependent on it. They can also be regarded as a generation with the highest risk of suicide, depression, and issues related to self-esteem. Ever wondered why they fall prey to such mental health issues?.. Jewel Treesa Jomy VI SEM JPEng Read More Which wolf would you feed more? We all know what depression is, and some of us could have been a prey to it at some point of time in our life.

Vidyut Bhasin Read More Sexual Abuse, Harassment: Speak up or remain silent? I was scrolling through Facebook just recently, and I saw a number of posts that had the tag “Me Too” in bold.

Though this movement had led people to talk about the nightmares they had experienced,.. Sana Miriam Joseph II SEM BA JPCS Read More Our lost childhood Childhood is a time of innocence, a time of wonder, and no amount of fame and money can make up for the loss of a childhood. It has lost its meaning in this age. It has been discarded, manipulated and molded into some forms that do not even have the essence of being a “child” anymore. Gone are those days when children used to play in the mud, outside with friends, and with the real toys rather than the virtual ones.. Eleanor Mikkimchi A Sangma VI Sem JPCS Read More My Classroom We all have sat in a classroom. Most of the times it is a four walled room, decorated with vibrant colored charts with pictures, explanation and memories, or even an open ground under the blue sky surrounded by green trees.

For me, a classroom is not just calculated by the way it is built, but by the people who build it.. Divya K.S I MA, MCJ Read More Library: the graveyard of books There was a time when books were the only source of information for people. We were devoid of any technology or e-gadgets that brought information to our fingertips. If we had to know about anything new, we had to rely on a book or a newspaper.

It certainly is not known for its extravagant decor or ambience. It’s just like any other typical college canteen; a simple hangout spot which has never failed to add different flavors to my life. It is an ideal place for time-pass sessions which are filled with vivid conversations and often something to learn from I consider.. Olevia K Sunny Read More Capturing reality on streets of Bangalore: Comedies and Tragedies To experience the butter and gutter of street photography, Bengaluru may not be the best place! But surely, this city is no little in giving photographic wonders that a street photographer would expect on his lens.
