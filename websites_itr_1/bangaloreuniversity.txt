Capital of India”, was established in July 1964 as an off shoot of the University of Mysore, primarily to include institutions of higher learning located in the metropolitan city of Bangalore and the districts of Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur, which eventually became a separate University. Initially, the two premier colleges of the city, the Central College (CC) and the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) formed the nucleus of Bangalore University. Soon after the establishment of Bangalore University, as a first step in the re-organization of courses, the University introduced Honours Courses in the year 1965-66. Three years Honour course in Botany, Chemistry, Economics, English, Geology, Kannada, Mathematics and Zoology, which were offered only at the University Post Graduate Departments have attracted many brilliant students. Honours passed students were admitted to Post Graduate Courses on priority and B.A./B.Sc. graduates, who marginally missed admission to the Post Graduate Courses were given an opportunity to join the final year Honours course and seek admission to Post Graduate Courses, thereafter. Since 1964, Bangalore University has grown both in size and strength to include a large number of affiliated colleges, P.G. Centers with a rich diversity of programme options. In consonance with this expansion, in 1973, the University moved into a new campus named ‘Jnana Bharathi’ (JB) located on a sprawling 1100 acres of land and shifted many of its post graduate departments to this newly established campus. At present, the JB Campus houses the office of the Vice Chancellor, Registrar, Registrar (Evaluation), Finance Officer and a large number of post graduate departments, Directorates, Centres of higher learning, NSS Bhavan, Outdoor Stadium and other support services.

Ambedkar Study and Research Centre, and Centre for Study on Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy. Bangalore University has completed Fifty-two years of fruitful existence and has come to be hailed as one of the largest University of Asia.

Currently affiliated to Bangalore University, the College provides six engineering courses – Electronics and Communication, Electrical and Electronics, Mechanical, Computer Science, Information Science and Civil Engineering. Situated at KR Circle in a greenery filled scenic expanse of 10 acres, UVCE is in the neighborhood of heavenly cubbon park and at an arm’s distance are some of the most important locations like Vidhana Soudha, Karnataka High Court and City Civil Court. The City campus currently houses the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication and Computer Science Engineering. Proximity to the Metro, City Bus Station and Railway Station connects one easily to any part of the city and helps in commutation to UVCE. Situated amidst Jnana Bharathi Campus spread over 50 acres, the hub of University Post graduate academic activities, the Engineering Campus has Departments of Civil Engineering and Architecture. This pioneer college has grown many folds, producing some of the best engineers in the country. Being an institution that functions on only Merit- Based CET seat allotment, the students obtaining admission are the creamy layer of the bright students in the state. The inexpensive fees structure is an aid and a driving reason for students of difficult financial stability and from the rural to join the college. The college crafts an environment for allround development of students encompassing both academic and extra-curricular activities. The students are hardworking, cultured, highly disciplined and have preserved the cherished values of this institution over the years. UVCE instills a zealous essence into the students which propels them to explore new realms of engineering and embark to achieve great things. Enhancing this factor is the experience that students gain learning at UVCE in a way diff erent from the education system of most conventional engineering colleges.

Our students also have been taking active part and are involved in every prestigious, national, regional and state level moots without exception. Legal aid and literacy programme: This is one of the components of the LL.B programme which the ULC puts its heart and soul in its realization. Students of the fourth and fifth year LL.B are taken to villages and made to enquire into the deficiencies prevailing in the villages through a scientific questionnaire. This includes, the day to day problems facing them, their level of literacy and the lack of legal knowledge. Through this method the students in these villages ascertain their problems. In this programme a group of students assisted by a staff member would provide the necessary advice tackle the routine legal, social and economic problems facing them. University Law College has been consistently holding this programme since the introduction of the 5 years LL.B programme in the year 1985-86 Court and Jail visit: Another component of legal education is court and jail visit. The students of the 4th and 5th year are made to visit courts and the central prison on appointed days to observe the proceedings of the Court and record their observations in diary for submission.
