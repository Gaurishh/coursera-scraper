Zaiba Fathima Hi, I am Kalyan Venkatesh B S a pass out of 2022 batch from KSSEM and currently placed in Mpokket and NTT Data Services. Firstly the infrastructure of the college is really good with the college being in a silent place, the college also has a basketball court, Xerox Shop and Canteen. Along with this there are annual sports and cultural activities to promote good culture among the students. The placement cell of the college helps every student to get placed, this starts from 1st year of the course itself. The college also promotes anti-ragging and no-tobacco use in the college premises. Along with that the college has helped me to step out of my comfort zone and work in any given environment. KALYAN VENKATESH B S If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration as quoted by ' Nicola Tesla', was proven right by the teachers of KSSEM. Firstly I would like to thank the editorial team for giving me this opportunity. When I first stepped into KSSEM College I never expected my life to take such a wonderful phase! Initially, when I was in my first year, I thought my engineering life would be study oriented, but as I entered the COMPUTER SCIENCE branch it all changed!! Teachers were so experienced and knowledgeable that they not only helped me to excel in academics but in building my character. They were very much supportive in all ways. Apart from classroom studies, KSSEM highly encourages students to take up extracurricular activities; the most memorable will be the college fest AAROHANA 2022. I am grateful to have had such an opportunity; this helped me immensely gain knowledge and also made me a betterment engineer. I would like to thank every member of our department and Management for their support and encouragement.

AMITHA S M Going into college, my only goal was to graduate with an engineering degree. But, looking back on the last four years, KSSEM has played an integral part in my development as a capable software engineer. The university has constantly provided me with good opportunities and resources to improve myself. The faculty at Computer Science Engineering is second to none. They are proficient, accessible, and patient. My bachelor's degree at KSSEM majoring in Software Technology has been eye-opening. The placement team here works hard to bring in several core and big companies; there are placement drives happening almost every day. The workshops and hackathons conducted by the various teams here at the institution helped me get a good overview of what is needed to work in a collaborative and professional environment. I am very grateful to them for assisting me in obtaining an internship at Celstream Technologies as an Interim Engineering Intern.

Zaiba Fathima Hi, I am Kalyan Venkatesh B S a pass out of 2022 batch from KSSEM and currently placed in Mpokket and NTT Data Services. Firstly the infrastructure of the college is really good with the college being in a silent place, the college also has a basketball court, Xerox Shop and Canteen. Along with this there are annual sports and cultural activities to promote good culture among the students. The placement cell of the college helps every student to get placed, this starts from 1st year of the course itself. The college also promotes anti-ragging and no-tobacco use in the college premises. Along with that the college has helped me to step out of my comfort zone and work in any given environment.

The Sangham has diversified its activities since its establishment over five decades ago. With a firm belief that quality and meaningful education only can lay the strong foundation for bringing about economic and social changes to the lives of thousand, the Sangham went about establishing educational institutions, starting with K.S. Polytechnic in 1992. Enthused with this success of its foray into technical education, the Sangham moved forward by starting the K. S Institute Of Technology (KSIT). Its Engineering College in the year 1999. In the following years both these institutions have carved for themselves an enviable niche through academic excellence achieved in a very short span of time. Following the success of KSIT, the Sangham ventured to start yet another technical institution, offering both engineering and management studies, K.S Group of Institutions (KSGI) was started in the year 2010. KSGI was renamed as K.S. School of Engineering & Management in 2011. KSSEM is now accredited by NAAC By providing FREE hostel accommodation and scholarship to the deserving students in the community, it has furthered its Commitment to education. Apart from the educational initiatives, on the cultural front, the Sangham has ventured to build and manage Convention centers. These serve as venues for community cultural events including conducting of mass marriages among the economically underprivileged in the Kamma Community. Towards encouraging and nourishing entrepreneurial trait among the community members, the Sangham also started Kammavari Credit Co-operative Society to mobilize deposits and finance enterprises. Furthermore, to be of service to the sick and the suffering, the Sangham has established a modern hospital in Bangalore with the latest diagnostic and treatment services. K. S School of Engineering and Management, KSSEM in short, was born on 1st July 2010, out of a commitment to the cause of providing value based technical education. Its strength lies in its founding objectives, the eminence of its management who are experienced men drawn from various fields, the coming together of dedicated, experienced and well qualified teaching staff, the establishment of a modern infrastructure with state-of-art equipment and laboratory facilities and the interactive relationship its forged with the industry. Excellent academic performance in the University examinations in all the years so far gives us the impetus to embark upon post graduate programmes and the establishment of a research cell in the near future. Establishment of these institutions will be a quick reality with hundreds of the Sangham members contributing generously. Set on the mission to excel in every activity that the Sangham has embarked upon, KSSEM carries forward the Sanghams vision under an eminent Governing Council, and an inspiring academic leadership translated in the enviable academic performance of its students. The objective of the management committee of KSSEM is to impart quality education and to help students develop the abilities of problem solving, creative thinking and adaptability in their chosen field. Realizing the importance of technical education, the energetic, dedicated and visionary members of the Kammavari Sangham under the leadership of our President Sri. R. Rajagopal Naidu, are executing their responsibilities sincerely for the growth of the institution since its establishment. Y.Ramachandra Naidu President K. Venkatesh Naidu Secretary D.
