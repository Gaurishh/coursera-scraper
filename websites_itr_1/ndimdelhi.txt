It gives me great joy to share that NDIM allowed me to secure not one but two job offers from campus, both with corporate giants i.e. Oyo Rooms and Amazon. The college puts genuine efforts in nurturing each student, preparing them both mentally and physically to take on the challenges of business & the corporate sector.

Many other reputed companies also came to the campus for placements and internships, the corporate resource cell of NDIM is excellent. I got internships with Parag Milk Foods & Firstnaukri.com and a Live project with Future Retail, all of which prepared me well for my final placement interviews. NDIM has the best and most helpful faculty and placement cell. Every time I faced challenges in Academics or placement, they were always there to help me. The immense exposure at this campus added a lot to my confidence and presentation skills. Overall, I am thankful to NDIM for all the learning and my placement in a desired profile with a great company like Dabur. Anjali Nagpal Ernst & Young (EY) In the beginning of my 4th semester, I got a final campus placement in my chosen profile with a renowned Financial Services company listed on the NSE. However, due to the sudden outbreak of covid-19 and related business disruption, my joining got substantially delayed. At this point NDIM was again very supportive and they helped me get an equally good alternate placement with a globally renowned financial services company, Ernst & Young. Overall, my 2-year journey of professional growth at NDIM was really thrilling and full of academic and corporate exposure. I enjoyed my stay at NDIM so much because I got to learn a lot of different things. The Faculty has been quite supportive at every step. Even at the time of final placements, when I was struggling in my initial interviews, the teachers and placement team were very cooperative, they helped me identify my weakness and overcome it, so I could get placed in my dream company. The corporate exposure at NDIM is phenomenal. In addition to plant visits, guest lectures, high profile corporate conferences, I was given practical experience through two internships with companies such as Aditya Birla and Ummeed Housing Finance. I am very thankful to every member of NDIM. Dinku Moni Saikia Byju’s When many people across the world were losing jobs, I got an amazing campus placement (during the Lockdown and global shut down) with India’s leading EdTech Company, Byju’s valued at over $11bn. NDIM was always there for its students despite the Lockdown. Our balance 4th semester classes were conducted professionally online & course was completed on time. The faculties were always available for guidance and the placement team continued to strive hard. Thankfully an Alumni friend from NDIM had recommended I join this college. Before joining NDIM I had no idea about its immense Industry connect and the corporate preparedness efforts it invests on each student. But NDIM taught me many new things and gave me lots of opportunities for Industry Interaction. I went for numerous industry visits where I got to observe & learn how industries work internally. I was also given Internships & live projects with Amul, Colgate and Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages. My campus assigned corporate mentor from Nokia was very supportive. The faculties are highly experienced and the classes offer a lot of learning. All these experiences have helped me get ready for success in my corporate life. Akshit Sharma Paytm Even during the pandemic NDIM made sure that placements continued. No matter how slow the pace of the corporate world but NDIM ensured its students got the best opportunities. Placement Interviews and preparation for us continued online when majority of the companies were busy cutting costs and laying off their employees. The constant preparation throughout the 2 years at NDIM and support from my teachers and placement cell ensured I get an excellent placement with a top brand like Paytm despite the pandemic. Even during the Lockdown, the college ensured our studies aren’t adversely affected and transitioned to quality online classes and exams within a week. In General, besides business education, the college also puts a lot of emphasis on soft skills which are one of the most essential skill sets needed in the corporate world.

Overall, NDIM offers a complete package for all the aspiring students who aim for a bright future. Raghav Gera Colgate I had a great experience at NDIM. I learnt a lot about Management Studies and the Corporate World. NDIM understands the needs of its students better and has the flexibility to incorporate their suggestions. I was quite impressed with the quality and efforts of its teachers and the Corporate resource centre. The final placements and internships & live projects offered from the Campus are Excellent. I got two internships in Dabur and Carlsberg which helped me immensely. I am incredibly happy and thankful to NDIM for my final campus Placement at Colgate Palmolive (one of the most renowned MNCs) almost 10 months before completion of my course. Prabin K Baby Dentsu What stands out about NDIM is the commitment to its students even during times of unprecedented adversity. The placement team helped me get a final campus placement in the biggest advertising agency network in the world during the country wide Lockdown imposed due to Covid-19. NDIM is rated as the Best Industry Linked MBA college for a reason. The diversity of students in the class, quality of faculty, commitment of staff and the steep learning curve it provides make NDIM truly unique. Many lectures within each course are taken by Industry experienced visiting faculty which adds a new dimension to our learning. The corporate mentoring programme is an amazing feature and much appreciated. Most well known brands come to the campus for internships, live projects and final placements. NDIM continues to train and groom its students till they are fit for the corporate world. Even if you are not sure what you want to do, NDIM provides you with the best resources and connects you with top professionals to help you discover your passion. I always wanted to get into a media & advertising firm and NDIM got me placed with Dentsu Aegis Network, which is one of the biggest advertising agency networks in the world. Himani Batra Amazon The covid-19 pandemic brought many challenges for all students. The job market became very tough suddenly. Though I was comfortably placed from the campus in a leading retain chain much before the pandemic related lockdown, but due to overnight disruption caused across businesses by covid-19, I had to leave that company. However, the faculty and placement team of NDIM was extremely supportive, they worked really hard (not enough words to appreciate their efforts) to get all such students placed again. So technically NDIM got me placed twice and the second time with the biggest e-commerce giant, Amazon. The positivity and willingness to actually train and make every student Industry ready is what distinguishes NDIM from other B-schools. This commitment can be seen in everyone at NDIM from the Top management, to the Faculty and the Staff. Thank you NDIM for your continuous support. Gaurav Singh ITC NDIM is one of the Best B-schools in India which knows how to transform you into a professional, enhance your global business knowledge and get you ready for the Corporate World. A lot of investment is made on preparing the students for their careers through active corporate mentoring, classroom to corporate classes, corporate skills development sessions and extensive industry exposure. Through the college I got a chance to work and train with great brands like Oyo rooms, Parag Milk and Colgate, and finally I am very happy to share that I got a campus placement with a big brand like ITC. The Corporate Resource Centre team at NDIM is really helpful. Ritika Suri Blackrock I came to NDIM with the Goal of Learning one new thing every day and today when I look back at the year that has elapsed, I feel it was an amazing journey full of learning and meaningful experiences. The training at NDIM helped me smoothly sail through my summer & winter internships. Besides conceptual knowledge, NDIM taught me other key skills like how to build professional networks, make the best use of given resources and make business case presentations before senior managers. The feeling of getting my final campus placement so early in my course with the world’s largest asset management company, Blackrock was amazing and it made my teachers and parents proud. I sincerely thank NDIM faculties, mentors and the placement cell for helping me grab the wonderful opportunity of working with Blackrock. V Vishnu Iyer Eureka Forbes During the first week of the Country wide Lockdown imposed because of Covid-19, I got my final campus placement with Eureka Forbes, a renowned Indian MNC in the Health & Hygiene Sector. NDIM is an amazing, result oriented B-School that continues to work hard for its students despite the lockdown and economic slowdown. The faculty is very knowledgeable and ensures they add tremendous value to each student. The placement cell is very hardworking and makes sure the best companies come for recruitment. Even the administrative staff is quite supportive and helpful. The quality of Corporate relations and Industry exposure distinguishes NDIM from other B-Schools. The college got me Internships and Live projects with top companies like HDFC, Fab Hotels, Colgate Palmolive and Interglobe (Indigo).

Thank you NDIM. Nandika Sharma Nestle I am very proud to be a member of the NDIM family and glad about my decision to join this prestigious Institute. NDIM proved to be quite an extraordinary management college which provided me constant mentoring, corporate exposure and practical knowledge which I lacked despite my prior work experience. NDIM made me plan out my management dream and the path to achieve it. The exposure was not only from many top internships and live projects with HDFC Bank, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Airconditioning, Oyo and Concepts International but NDIM offered a lot more. I got personalized reviews about my interviews and shortcomings; NDIM always ensures that each student gets individual attention. The college organises regular guest lectures which some of us due to our ignorance don’t value initially but it is one such guest lecture by the Chairman & MD of Nestle which was the initial step to my final campus placement with Nestle, the world’s largest food and beverage company. I am forever indebted to NDIM. Akash Bhaduri Amazon When I first learnt about NDIM, I heard many good things and in hindsight each of the positive things I heard were accurate. From the first day of college, NDIM has tried to get me ready for the Corporate world through my multiple internships and live projects with leading brands, various Industrial visits, corporate speaker series and all of it obviously culminating in great campus placements. From the campus I got placed in one of India’s most popular FMCD companies in Oct 2019 much before finishing my 3rd Semester. However, due to the Corona virus related economic turmoil my confirmed joining date kept getting delayed. At this difficult juncture, NDIM offered me a lot of support. Despite the problems in the job market due to Covid 19, the college helped me get placed again, this time with the World’s biggest online retailer Amazon. I am extremely thankful to NDIM, definitely the Best Industry Linked B-School in the Country. Navneet Chandra Delhivery Despite the pandemic, lockdown and a tough job market, NDIM kept training and preparing us online for job interviews. The placement team kept working rigorously so that we can get placed on time and secure a good starting position in our careers. I am excited to share that even during these challenging times, I got a great campus placement in Delhivery, India’s largest B2B & C2C Logistics Courier Service. NDIM has helped me evolve as a person and provided me with the confidence & skills to be successful in the corporate world. The college also got me internships in two top companies i.e. Bajaj Finance and Outlook India Magazine. Both of them offered a very good practical learning experience. NDIM has Excellent faculty with prior Industry experience and they not only provide us with academic knowledge but also share practical insights to business cases. I am really thankful to NDIM for giving me such a great start to my career. Aastha Gupta Deloitte My experience at NDIM is brilliant. NDIM helped me transform myself from an average individual to a thorough professional. The teachers are easily approachable and help us groom ourselves personally and professionally. This B-School is the Best Industry linked institute which provides extensive corporate exposure to its students. Corporate Skill Development classes which help us prepare for the business world are supplemented with active preparatory sessions for each company; personal attention is given to every student. NDIM helped me transform my weaknesses into my strengths leading to my placement in my Dream Company Deloitte just at the start of my second year. Shubham Gupta To The New In the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown there was no certainty how things will move forward. I saw my friends at other Business Schools struggling. However, NDIM handled the pandemic and lockdown smoothly. Classes swiftly moved online and exams were conducted without any delays. From the next day of lockdown, mock classes and tests were done to ensure no one faces any difficulties going forward. Placement preparation also continued full force and despite the upheaval in the corporate sector, I got an amazing campus placement in To The New, a leading digital technology company, with offices across Delhi, Dubai and New York. The learning quotient at NDIM is very high. Our teachers made sure that we got conceptual clarity and are Industry ready. For the first time, I learnt to focus equally on practical learning & application of concepts rather than just gaining theoretical knowledge. I am grateful to NDIM for the opportunity to interact with many corporate leaders and mentors at various college platforms. My internships were also very useful. All this learning eventually led to my awesome final campus placement despite the challenging economic situation. Thank you NDIM. Kirti Patel Byju’s I am grateful to NDIM for my final placement in the middle of the Covid 19 pandemic related Lockdown, in my desired role of HR with one of India’s top companies Byju’s at a high package. This shows the commitment of the college towards each of its students. I got placed at a time when worldwide people were losing their jobs. NDIM gave me a lot more than I expected. This college gives its students the freedom to think of an idea and test its practical applications. I feel extremely lucky to be in such a progressive environment which is not limited to course books only. The Institute has various facilities to help you evolve as a student, from most modern classrooms, a well-stocked library, hi-tech IT labs to management club activities and many corporate and social events. I found NDIM to be the Best Campus in Delhi. The faculty members are very good, knowledgeable and have the industry experience which is required to give us practical insights and effectively discuss business case studies. I also got multiple internships from the campus with Fortis Hospital and Centre for educational growth and research. The academic learning and corporate experience with a world class infrastructure at NDIM has given me the skills needed for lifelong excellence. I am really looking forward to my career with Byju’s. Kaushik Das Amazon Coming from the North East part of India where Industrial exposure is limited, I researched many colleges and decided to study at NDIM as it is located in the heart of the Capital city and is the Best Industry Linked B-School of India. The experience at NDIM was great, it offered me immense Corporate exposure. I did internships with Edelweiss and Oyo Rooms and a Live project with HDFC Bank. A healthy learning environment at the campus, group projects, team presentations and participation in events organised by student led clubs like the Entrepreneurship club and Marketing club helped me overcome my shy nature and get a campus placement early in the third semester in one of India’s most prestigious companies. I was supposed to join a few months later but because of the sudden India wide lockdown and the business uncertainty caused by Covid 19, my joining date was substantially delayed. I approached the college placement cell with my problem and they helped me immensely. Despite the slowdown and layoffs across many sectors, the college got me another placement with my dream company, Amazon. Harmeet Singh Batra Adani Wilmar I came to NDIM from Rajasthan and I have had a great experience here. If I compare myself to the person I was two years ago, then today I am a much better communicator and decision maker with good analytical, inter-personal and technical skills. The course curriculum & teaching pedagogy at NDIM are highly engaging and advanced and perhaps NDIM is the only B-School to provide within its PGDM (MBA), modern courses on Business Analytics and Data Visualization through Tableau & Power Bi. I was always aiming for the FMCG sector and keeping this goal in mind the placement team got me two internships in the same field with Future Group which immensely helped me gain practical experience in my chosen Industry. I warmly thank all the highly qualified professors at NDIM who were instrumental in shaping my career.

Arushi Gautam Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) My journey with NDIM has been full of positivity and encouragement, from the first semester till the fourth semester.

I cracked the interview process of my dream company Amazon, in these challenging times through the support of my NDIM family. Throughout the Lockdown, NDIM kept in touch with the students, helped them complete their final semester online and conducted exams on time. The faculties were just a phone call away and showed full support. Prior to the pandemic I experienced awesome learning through classes with experienced faculty and corporate mentors.

More than Two decades of our meaningful existence under the Charitable “Society for Employment and Career Counseling” (Regd.), has been a period of great achievements and satisfaction.With strong support of its Board of Directors, dedicated team of faculty members, administrative staff, excellent corporate relations and infrastructure-NDIM is reckoned as a premier Business School in India.At NDIM, our focus is to develop business leaders who can tackle challenges of industry by continuously working towards new challenges and situations. We emphasize on building business leaders of tomorrow and I would like to reinforce that our endeavor is to keep a balance between the education we impart and what the industry requires.We have accepted education and training as the primary mode of serving the society at large. This should not be taken to imply by any stretch of imagination that we are grooming only future professional managers. We do understand that unless the downtrodden, vulnerable sections of society, are served to the best of our ability, we would be failing in our social responsibilities.I take this opportunity to thank His Holiness, Sri Sri Ravi Shankarji, for giving valuable tips on “Stress Management” at our platform to not only the students and faculty of NDIM but also to the corporate world. We believe that unless the growth of religious causes, moral values and business ethics are integrated, managements cannot succeed. I am grateful to the corporate world and the distinguished people from academia for their continuous support.I believe, by working together in an environment of trust and support, we would be able to achieve more success and fame in the years to come.Late Shri Jaswant Rai BansalFounder Chairman, NDIM How much is 3+3 60 & 50(B&C), Tughlakabad Institutional Area, Behind Batra Hospital, New Delhi 110062 011-40111000, 1800-419-0606, 08882468367, 09910695359 +91-11-29965136 [email protected] Programmes Overview PGDM PGDM (Marketing) PGDM (Finance) Specializations Testimonials Overview PGDM PGDM (Marketing) PGDM (Finance) Specializations Testimonials Industry Interface Recruiters @ NDIM Corporate Resource Centre Global Leaders @ NDIM Corporate Mentoring Internships Live Projects Plant Visits Industry Awards Training & Consultancy Seminars and Conferences Personality Grooming Recruiters @ NDIM Corporate Resource Centre Global Leaders @ NDIM Corporate Mentoring Internships Live Projects Plant Visits Industry Awards Training & Consultancy Seminars and Conferences Personality Grooming International Immersion International Live Projects International Faculties Study Abroad Programme Indo-Japan Collaboration Ambassadors @ NDIM International Live Projects International Faculties Study Abroad Programme Indo-Japan Collaboration Ambassadors @ NDIM About NDIM About NDIM Founder Chairman’s Message CEO & Vice Chairman’s Message Infrastructure Academic Advisory Council AICTE Approval FI and RA Vacancy for ICSSR Project Staff Handbook Students Handbook About NDIM Founder Chairman’s Message CEO & Vice Chairman’s Message Infrastructure Academic Advisory Council AICTE Approval FI and RA Vacancy for ICSSR Project Staff Handbook Students Handbook Online Grievance Student Grievance Redressal Committee FI and RA Vacancy for ICSSR Project Internal Complaint Committee(ICC) SC/ST Committee Contact Us NDCLGE MOOC & Swayam Courses Campus Mall Anti Ragging NDIM Diorama CANCELLATION/REFUND POLICY Stakeholder Feedback Journal NIRF 2025 ERP Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Mandatory Disclosure FAQ’s Online Grievance Student Grievance Redressal Committee FI and RA Vacancy for ICSSR Project Internal Complaint Committee(ICC) SC/ST Committee Contact Us NDCLGE MOOC & Swayam Courses Campus Mall Anti Ragging NDIM Diorama CANCELLATION/REFUND POLICY Stakeholder Feedback Journal NIRF 2025 ERP Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Mandatory Disclosure FAQ’s Copyright © 2025 NDIM Delhi | Powered by NDIM Delhi Apply Now Call Us Enquire Now Apply Now Call Us Enquire Now Prospectus Scroll to Top Call us on 1800-419-0606 for any queries Enquire Now Name* Email* Phone* City Query Please prove you are human by selecting the key.
