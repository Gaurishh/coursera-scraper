The Soul of Sound: Elephant Bells and GuitarElephant Bells - A Sonic Reflection of Incredible IndiaIn the heart of Indian tradition and temple rituals, Elephant Bells have long symbolized majesty, spirituality, and celebration. These handcrafted metallic bells, often hung around the necks of sacred elephants, create a delicate, resonant sound that echoes through forests, temple courtyards, and festivals. Their rhythmic sway and shimmering tone are not just musical, they are spiritual, ceremonial, and deeply rooted in Indian heritage.The Elephant has been a revered figure in Indian mythology and culture, often associated with wisdom and power especially embodied in Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity of beginnings and knowledge. The bells capture the essence of this legacy, evoking both reverence and mystery.In TERRY AND BELLS, each bell has been carefully recorded to preserve this cultural richness ranging from gentle rolls and bows to cluster hits and textured noise patches. It's a sonic tribute to Incredible India, offering composers and sound designers an authentic taste of Indian ceremonial life and folk instrumentation.The Guitar - "A Universal Voice of Emotion "Paired with the bells is the timeless beauty of the guitar, captured in plucks, taps, FX, and harmonic textures. The guitar is a globally beloved instrument, but when played with sensitivity and soul, it becomes much more than a sound source, it becomes a storyteller.The warm, resonant tones in TERRY AND BELLS reflect not just technique, but emotion. You ll hear the intimacy of finger-picked notes, the percussive energy of hand taps, and the haunting qualities of subtle FX, all designed to complement the spiritual character of the bells.Together, the Elephant Bells and Guitar create a cross-cultural fusion, a soundscape where ancient Indian tradition meets global musicality. It's an invitation to explore, compose, and connect with deeper narratives through sound.3 GB LIBRARY | 45 FREE  KONTAKT INSTRUMENTSCategory: Elephant Bells (10)Patch Names: Master Patch, Mallets Patches, Rolls, Bows, Clusters and Noise PatchesCategory: Guitar Patches (5)Patch Names: Master Patch, Pluck, Tap, Percussion, FX PatchesCategory: Sound Design (30)Patch Names: ArpSticks, Bell Rain, BellMond, Bells of Lal, Christmas Bells, Crazy Arps, Emotional Releases, Gamelanesq, Glass Pluck, HarpsiPluck, In Your Face Pluck, In Your Face Tap, Legato Colors ModWheel, Lush Ambient Pads, Narnia Bells, One Pluck, Pitch Distortion, Pitched Rhythmic Bell Movement, Rain Pad, Random Reverse Pluck, Retro Grunge, Reverse Bells, Rhythmic Pad, Rhythmic Pads Variation, Rhythmic Pads, Sample and Hold Pluck, Shiny Bells, SoloLegato, Sprinkle Bell, Wobble SynthBonus Content : A Cubase project file is included created by Alessandro Ponti from Italy demonstrating how to use the TERRY AND BELLS instruments in a musical context Important note : Works with Kontakt 5.8.1 or higher (full version required)Free Kontakt Player will run in demo mode for 30 minutes onlyWant a Career in Music Production or Sound Engineering?Crypto Cipher Academy (Delhi) is one of India's best-rated institutes for:Music Production Diploma - https://www.cryptocipheracademy.com/music-production-diploma-courseSound Engineering Diploma - https://www.cryptocipheracademy.com/sound-engineering-courseLive Sound Engineering Course - https://www.cryptocipheracademy.com/live-sound-engineering-courseWhether you're from Delhi, Punjab, Ladakh, Mumbai, or anywhere in India,our Music Production & Sound Engineering programs prepare you for a real-world music career with hands-on training and studio sessions.Download InstructionsAdd to Cart - https://cryptocipher.in/product/terry-bells-free-kontakt-library/ Close Music Production & Sound Engineering for Chandigarh-Mohali (Punjab) Best Music Production & Sound Engineering Course for Chandigarh-Mohali Punjab Students - Join Crypto Cipher in DelhiWhy Punjab Students Choose Crypto Cipher for Their Music CareersMany talented students from Punjab, including cities like Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Patiala, have taken the leap and joined Crypto Cipher Academy in Delhi to launch their careers in Music Production, Sound Engineering, and Live Sound Engineering.The reason is simple - Crypto Cipher offers real-world, industry-standard training from professionals who build world-class sound libraries and work on live and studio projects daily.From creating hit tracks to mixing at live concerts, our students become job-ready, versatile audio professionals who thrive in any sound environment.Punjab-Based Student Success StoriesWe're proud to have mentored several successful students from Punjab, who are now actively working in the music industry:Gurpreet BMP - Punjabi Film Composer | Music Arranger | Mixing Engineer | Working as Successful Music Producer ( Mohali, Punjab)Gurpreet BMP enrolled in the Music Production course at Crypto Cipher Academy in 2016 and has since built a thriving career in the Indian music industry.

Close Creating A Future Bass Track (Part 2) In this article we will focus on the Chords, Leads and Basses used in the drop section, take a look at the music theory and explore a few tips that can make the process of coming up with melodies or chord progressions easier.In case you have missed Part 1 of this series, we recommend that you read that first and then come back to this article.Chord ProgressionWe will be making our drop in G Major Scale so go ahead and turn on the scale function within your DAW. You may also want to fold the piano roll of your DAW to the selected scale (shown in the image below).Major 7th and minor 7th chords are used frequently in Future Bass. Extended chords like Add 9th chords are also quite common. For our track we will be using the Chord Progression:|| G Major 7th | G add 9 | B minor 7th | D add 9 || As you can see in the image above we have altered the standard voicing of the chords to make them sound better. As long as we stay in the selected scale, we can experiment with these voicings till we get the right feel for our chord progression. Once we are happy with how the chord progression sounds, we can alter the rhythm of certain chords to add more energy to the composition and compose a B section for the drop. Along with altering the rhythm we can also add some extra notes in the higher or lower registers to add more movement to our music. It is important not to add to many notes at this stage. We need to maintain space for other elements and keep things interesting. As you can see in the image below, we have largely kept things similar to our initial progression, only adding some variations in the 2nd and 4th bars.At the moment we are using a default saw wave from Wavetable (check image below) to map out chords, we will be covering sound design in the next part where this basic sound will be altered into something much more complex.Main Melody or LeadNow that our chord progression is ready, we can start experimenting with different melodies that will be in scale with our chords and also fill in the empty spaces in between. For our composition, we want our lead to be slightly offset from the rhythm of drum pattern. To achieve this, we will use the concept of syncopation where certain notes in our melody will land on the upbeat to create rhythmic variations. We also want the melody to sound uplifting, so we are using the G Major Pentatonic scale (G, A, B, D, E) instead of the regular G Major. As you can see in the image below the melody is kept very simple and with the chord progression they almost act like a call and response but it is not very obvious.Another important trick that has been used here, is to always rest on one of the chord degrees (notes played in the chord), this makes the lead resonate better with our chord progression. We have also varied the velocity of the notes according to taste to add a bit of humanization.We will also create a variation for this melody so that the drop does not sound repetitive. We are using a few notes out of the G Major Pentatonic scale for this section, other than that we are keeping the feel similar to our first melody (as shown in the image below). For both the melodies we are using the default triangle wave from Wavetable. We will alter the tone in part 3 of this series, when we explore sound design.BassThe bassline for our track will be extremely simple. We will be placing the bass notes on beat to accent the downbeats. The main role for the bass is to thicken the sound of the chord progression. Hence we have used the root notes of our chords as the main bassline with some minute additions (shown in the image below).We will also create a variation for our bass part like we had done for our chord progression and lead. In this version we are going to keep things similar to the first pattern but we will add some more syncopated notes to create contrast (check image below).We have made the bassline using the default sine wave from Wavetable as shown in the image below.ConclusionThus we have created a chord progression, lead and bass section with a variation for our Future Bass track while exploring some tips to help us be more expressive and efficient with our note selection. In the next article we will explore various sound design techniques to give our music the Future Bass sound.

Close Dynamic EQ With Ableton Live Stock Devices IntroductionDynamic EQs combine the best features of an EQ and a Compressor/Expander. Unlike a regular parametric EQ, a dynamic EQ boosts or attenuates a frequency band in reaction to the incoming signal. A regular EQ can remove, among other things, harshness from a signal provided that these unwanted frequencies are fixed, if they move around in the frequency spectrum then the harshness would not be suppressed in areas where the EQ is not active. This is especially true for a pitched signal where the problematic frequencies may move up down parallel to changes in pitch. A dynamic EQ would be a smarter choice in this scenario because it would attenuate a frequency band only when the incoming signal surpasses a user-defined threshold.In Ableton, we have the option of turning any stock or third-party EQ to a Dynamic EQ by using stock plugins. In this article, we will explore some options on how to implement dynamic EQ with devices like EQ Eight, Channel EQ and EQ Three.Ableton's Envelope FollowerThe Envelope Follower is the main component for making any EQ react dynamically to the incoming audio signal. It is located in the Modulators folder in Audio Effects under Categories. This device can be mapped to any parameter within Ableton. The mapped parameter would then be increased or decreased in reaction to the levels of the input signal. Consequently the magnitude of the boost or cut adjusts itself in relation to the magnitude of the input signal.    As you can see in the image above, the envelope follower has a simple interface. We can use the Map button on the top left corner (beneath the device header) to map this device to any device parameter within Ableton. Moving to the right from the Map button we find the range controls (minimum and maximum respectively). This can be used to set some limit within which the mapped parameter will operate. On the top right corner we have the multi-map button that gives us seven more mapping options with their dedicated range controls. At the bottom, starting from the left side we have the Gain button that sets the amount of gain (positive or negative) to be applied to the mapped device parameter in reaction to incoming signal's volume envelope. Moving to the right of Gain, we have the Rise and Fall parameters that set the attack and release of the mapped parameter respectively. Moving to the right from Fall we have the Delay knob which delays the envelope of the incoming signal. Now that we are familiar with Envelope Follower interface, let us see how it can be paired with other Ableton Stock Plugins.Dynamic EQ8To turn EQ Eight into a dynamic EQ, let us create a track and insert an Envelope Follower followed by an EQ Eight. We will map the the Gain parameter for Filter 3. Select Filter 3 first, then click on the Map button on the envelope follower. After clicking the Map button click on the Gain parameter for Filter 3 in EQ Eight. Now we have successfully turned this filter into a Dynamic EQ band.  To make this work smoothly, we will also set both the maximum and minimum settings of the Range in the Envelope Follower to 50%. If we want our dynamic EQ to attenuate this frequency band when the amplitude of the incoming signal increases, then we will lower the maximum value for the range and vice-versa. If we increase or decrease the minimum value then the Dynamic EQ will work in reverse, which can be useful too. A good way to familiarise oneself with how the changes in the range controls affects the mapped parameter, use a four bar hi-hat pattern, where the hi-hats are paced 2 beats apart for four bars. Then activate the loop switch. Now you will be able to see exactly how the EQ reacts to the incoming signal in respect to the changes in the minimum and maximum value of the Range control. Now we can send any musical signal through this device chain and boost or attenuate different parts of the frequency spectrum according to the changes in amplitude. We can also adjust the Rise and Fall parameters of the Envelope Follower same as we use the attack and release controls of a dynamic EQ to make the response smoother.We can also explore some more experimental mappings with our EQ Eight. One powerful addition we can make to our setup is to dynamically affect the resonance of the mapped EQ band. We can do this either with a second Envelope Follower (if we want more control) or by using the multi-map options on the existing device.As you can see in the image above, the Envelope Follower is mapped both to Filter 3 Gain and Filter 3 Resonance (Q factor). This setting will now have a higher bandwidth at higher levels of attenuation and vice-versa. By inverting the range you can reverse the behaviour of the Resonance control.  We can also map other parameters of the EQ with the Envelope Follower to create interesting and experimental sonic variations. Look at he image below, the Envelope Follower has been mapped to the Scale control of EQ eight. The frequency bands are flat when no sound is playing, but whenever there is any incoming signal the bands two and four will get boosted while bands 1 and 3 will be attenuated.Other Stock Dynamic EQ Options in AbletonWe can use the Envelope Follower to dynamically affect other Ableton stock EQs like EQ Three, Channel EQ and Auto-filter. As you can see in the image above, the envelope follower is being used to control the High Gain knob for the Channel EQ. This chain is great for creating broad tonal changes in the spectrum but not suited for more surgical tasks.Similar to the previous example a dynamic EQ Three can also be very useful for live performance scenarios where a broad frequency band might have to be removed from a track to make space for leads, vocals, drums etc.In image above, these settings would remove the mid frequencies of the incoming signal when played at normal levels but when the level falls below -30dBFS the frequency band will gradually come back up to fill the spectrum.ConclusionUsing a third party dedicated Dynamic EQ might be an easier fix rather than using the Envelope Follower every time. However, it cannot be overlooked that this method gives us a greater level of control on the EQ band and its movements. This is extremely useful for both surgical and experimental tasks like removing harshness, boosting desirable frequencies, frequency based side-chaining and even sound design. Close Creating A Future Bass Track (Part 1) In this article we will create a future bass drum pattern and discuss a few techniques you can use to make your patterns stand out. Let us start off with some ground rules. Future Bass tracks vary between 130 - 160BPM. For our project we will set the BPM at 150. Our time signature will remain 4/4 just like most tracks in the genre.Sample SelectionFuture Bass has very punchy drums. So it is always ideal to start off with a good sample. Starting with a bad sample will lead to endless processing that will probably not end up sounding on par with a good sample anyways. There are a lot free resources on the internet where you will find some good samples. Once you have your samples ready we will move on to programming our drum pattern.Programming the kickSelect a punchy kick with a short decay. You can drag your audio sample directly into your track and arrange them on the grid, but we will use midi for our project. Insert an empty midi channel in Ableton (Shift+Ctrl+T for Windows and Shift+Cmd+T for Mac). Double click on your midi channel and then double click on your kick sample. Your kick should open up in a simpler, in the device view of your midi channel. Switch the simpler to 1-Shot mode from the default Classic Mode. In this mode the sample triggered plays till the end of the sample.Now highlight the first 8 bars of your grid and insert midi clip (Shift+Ctrl+M in Windows and Shift+Cmd+M for Mac) and double click on it to open up you piano roll.When using midi always remember the note C3 will play the kick sample in its original form. Now go ahead and program the kick pattern like shown in the image belowAs you can see we have placed a kick at the beginning of every bar. There is an extra kick at the end on beat 4 of bar 4 which will create a nice variation. We have also added variations in the velocity of our kicks which helps keep things more organic.Programming the SnareInsert your snare sample into a new midi track as we did with the kick, choose 1-shot mode and insert a midi clip.Future bass snares are tonal in character. Our snare is in G note so we will pitch it up by two semitones to A note, so it matches the scale our track we will create in this series. Now program your snare with the velocity changes as shown in the image below.The snares are placed in beat 3 of every bar. We vary the velocity so that it does not sound monotonous.Programming Hi HatsWe will start off with our closed hat first. Go ahead insert your closed hat sample into an empty midi channel and program in the pattern according to the image given below.The hi hats are quite varied in their velocity to create a groove. We also like shift the pitch of certain hits according to tase to create bounce. Also lower the volume of the track by 12.We will insert another midi channel and insert an open hi hat sample in it. For this one we will set the simpler to gate so that the sample plays according to the note length in our piano roll. This is important so that we can imitate the feel of a real hi hat by having our open hat sample cutoff when the closed hat sample is triggered.Program your open hi hat pattern as shown in the image below.Adding CymbalsWe will need a crash sample at the beginning of drum pattern to add some impact to the groove. We will not be using midi for our Crash, instead we will directly insert our crash into an audio channel.We will also add a reverse crash at the end of or 8 bar loop by reversing our original crash sample, putting it on bar 7 and dropping the volume considerably (as shown below).Adding some extra touchesA nice touch to add in any future bass track is a reverse snare leading upto our snare hit in certain parts to add more interest into the groove. Also layering foley samples with your drum hits can create added variations and textures. We have also added a reverse kick at the end of bars 2 and 6 respectively. Always use fades to have your foley and reverse sounds sit well with the overall groove and eliminate any clicks. Look at the image below for reference.We are also adding two percussion hits at the end of bar 8 to create a drum fill so that it can lead in smoothly to the next cycle. We also pitched the first perc hit down an octave to add some more variation.This completes part 1 of our future bass drum pattern for the time being. Watch this space for Part 2 and 3, where we will go over the bass and melody programming for a trap beat. We will also upload the whole project (Ableton Live Set) as a free download, once all three parts are uploaded. Close How to Make Melodic Trap Beats: Part 3 (Bass) Trap basses generally consist of 808's. They have a long decay and are often distorted. 808 selection is extremely important for our final mix. You should always preview your bass sound with your kick in any genre of music, to see that they are not conflicting with each other. If our 808 is muffling the kick from the beginning, then processing will not be able to solve our problem.1. Tuning 808's808's need to be tuned correctly to the key of our beat. Once you have selected your 808, draw it into the device view of an empty midi track. Your 808 will open up in an instance of simpler. Insert a tuner after the simpler. Now we can monitor the pitch played by the 808.We can adjust the transposition of our sample from the 'Controls' tab in the simpler. We will tune our 808 as such, that when we hit the C note on our midi keyboard, the sample is also triggered in the same pitch.2. Programming the Bass808's follow the kick drum. You can copy the kick pattern directly into your 808 and then make changes in the pitch.As you can see in the image provided above, the 808 in being trigger along with the kick. Now we can vary its pitch so that we can follow the melody of our beat.While varying the pitches you can experiment with the octave, fifth and fourth. You can also transpose your bassline up a few octaves to check if you bass melody is sounding good with the main melody, then transpose it back down.3. 808 SlidesSlides add some interesting movement to your 808. To activate this function go back to the controls tab and select Glide and set the time according to your liking. Our glide time will be 107ms. This parameter determines, how much time it will take for one note to glide up/down to the next. Glide can only happen when our instrument is monophonic and we have overlapping notes.Now, we can add some overlapping notes so that our 808 glides in-between them.4. Pitch BendsPitch bends can add even more expression to your 808. We can bend both up and down, depending on what sound we want to create. You can use the envelope editor to draw your pitch bend curves.As you can see in the image above, we have bent the pitches of quite a few notes. All these changes add to the dynamics of our 808 and help its presence in the mix.5. Pitch EnvelopeAdding a pitch envelope on our 808 can further enhance its punch. A pitch envelope determines how many semitones up will the sample play when triggered and how long will it take for the sample to come down to its original pitch (determined by the Decay Time of the pitch env).6. Adding DistortionTrap 808's are distorted to make them more present in the beat. If our 808 does not have much mid and high-mid content, then it can get buried when played on bad speakers. Distortion can make up for this disadvantage by adding some crunch to our 808. We need to use this effect in moderation so that we don't lose any low frequencies from the bass.As you can see in the image above, we are using multiple distortion types to colour our 808. The trick is to use them minimally. All three effects together will add some nice midrange to our 808's.Now that our 808's have been processed we can start recording vocal ideas and compose additional sections to complete the song. If you want to follow along with our Ableton project file, then click on the link provided below to download the .alp file:Crypto Cipher Academy_Melodic Trap Beat Tutorial (Ableton Project Download) Close How to Make Melodic Trap Beats: Part 2 (Melody and Chord Progression) The melody and chord progression of our trap beat is extremely important for the vibe our beat is trying to create. Most trap beats are mostly based on minor scales. We will compose our melody in E minor.In the image provide above you can see the notes of an E minor scale. Needless to say that our chord progression will also consist of a combination of these notes.In Ableton, you can turn Scale Mode on so that the notes of your scale is highlighted on the piano roll. This will help us to adjust notes quickly.1. Chord ProgressionWe will start off with writing our chord progression. The chords that can be used in our scale are E minor, F#dim, G major, A minor, B minor, C major and D major. Our chord progression for this beat will be: E minor | G major | E minor | B minor (i - III - i - v)As you can see in the image above, we have varied the velocities of our notes to create a realistic feel to the chords. We are using a chorus heavy Electric Piano to make our chords. We are also adding some mid-side processing to make our chords sound wide in the mix.Once we have the basic progression programmed, we can try some 7th or add9th chords to make our sound more interesting. If you look at the image below, we have added an extra 7th to our chords also varies the length, start and end positions of the notes to add a more realistic feel to our sound.Now that our chord progression is created, we can move onto our melody.2. MelodyFor our melody section, we need to be able to create tension and release with the notes of our scale. The 2nd, 4th and 6th notes of our scale will create tension while 1st, 3rd and 5th will create release or resolution. An easy pattern to follow is to use tension notes at the end of a bar, while starting the next bar with a note that will release that tension. Let us say we add an A note on the last 1/8th note of a bar, then we will begin the next bar with an E note which will release the tension created by the preceding note. In the image provided below, the highlighted notes are our tension notes. Trap melodies also follow a basic call and pattern, where the first part of the melody raises a musical question, resolved by the following part.We are repeating the call part of our melody (comprised of 2 bars) thrice, before playing our answer (also comprised of 2 bars) only once, thus creating our 8 bar melody.Another helpful tip would be to fold your piano roll according to our selected scale so that only the pertinent notes are displayed. This will help us to create melodies fast.3. Sampling the MelodyThis step is absolutely optional, but a lot of producers like to bounce their melody and chord progressions into a single audio track. This helps us is experimenting with different chops and pitch variations. You can also try reversing certain sections to make your sound stand out. To consolidate your chord and melody into a single audio track, add an empty audio track (named Sampled Melody) and route the output of the required tracks into the Sampled Melody track.Now arm the newly added track and hit the global record button. Hit stop once your sample is completely recorded.Now we can slice up the audio as we like and add interesting variations in different parts of the melody.As you can see in the image above, we have reversed our sample and adding some creative warping effects to make it sound interesting.4. The Melody SectionAfter programming all your melodies and harmonies, it is important to group them so we can apply bus processing on these sounds. Control the lows of your melody sound so that they don't clash with our 808's and kicks.The bus signal chain is displayed in the image above. The equaliser is cutting out low frequencies, the glue compression is adding some gain reduction to bring everything together and the redux is adding some texture to the whole melody.Watch this space for Part 2 and 3, where we will go over the bass and melody programming for a trap beat. We will also upload the whole project (Ableton Live Set) as a free download, once all three parts are uploaded.If you want to follow along with our Ableton project file, then click on the link provided below to download the .alp file:Crypto Cipher Academy_Melodic Trap Beat Tutorial (Ableton Project Download) Close How to Make Melodic Trap Beats_Part 1 (Drums) Make Melodic Trap Beats Part 1Trap Drums are not complicated at all. There are a few basic elements that we need to make a bouncy trap beat. A trap drum kit consists of a kick, clap and hi-hat at its core. You can add other snares, vocal one-shots and percussion samples to fit your style. Our three core drum sounds need to be punchy and short. Trap beats have a tempo of 140-160BPM. We will make our beat in 140BPM.1. The KickTrap kick drum selection is extremely important. The kick needs to sit perfectly with our bass/sub in the mix. A short kick drum with a very emphasised attack would cut through the mix much easier than a sub heavy low-kick. Drag your sample into an audio track and start laying them according to Ableton's grid. You can turn the metronome on for reference.As you can see in the image above, we have altered the clip gain of a few kicks to give them a human feel. We are also using fades on the tail to articulate a few samples differently. We are not altering the clip gain of the kick on the first beat of the sample to create an accent.We are also adding a transient shaper on our kick track to enhance its attack. You can use any transient designer plugin, but we are using Bitter Sweet V3 which is a free plugin. You can analyse the settings we are using, for reference, in the image provided below. Do not push your transient designer too much, it can easily make things sound worse. We are pushing the attack just by 6% to maintain the characteristics of the original sound.We are also adding a saturator on our kick to add some more girth and presence. Distorted kicks are staple in the trap genre.2. The ClapThe clap acts like an anchor to our beat. Select a clap sample with some punch. You can also use an 808 style clap with a little bit of distortion. Drag your clap into an empty audio track and lay them on every third beat of the bar.As you can see in the image above, we are using fade to vary our claps. You can use the clip gain here too, to create variations. We are also high passing our clap at 346Hz to eliminate the undesirable low frequencies. Always listen to your sound while high passing. If you are too drastic with your filter then it will make the clap sound thin and weak.3. The Hi-hatWe are using midi for our hat because it will easier for us to create rolls and and pitch variations later. Drag you hat sample into the device view of an empty midi track in Ableton. your sample will open up in a simpler.We are using a 808 style closed hat sample here. We are laying down a very simple 8th note hat pattern as a starting point.As you can see in the image above, we have varied the velocities these hats, keeping an accent on the fist beat of every bar.Another characteristic of any bouncy trap beat is a hi hat roll. We are using some pitch and velocity variations on these rolls, to make our beat interesting.If you hat sample has any low rumble in the spectrum then use a high pass filter to preserve the frequencies we require.4. The SnareA lot of trap beats use different snares to create variations and add bounce. We are using a short high-pitched snare for our beat. Drag your snare sample into an empty audio track. We will use the clip gain and fade to create some variation. We will also have the snare much lower in the mix, than our clap so that it almost sounds like a ghost-note. You can adjust the level of your snare according to you liking.We are also high passing the snare track to remove the unrequited low frequencies.5. The PercussionPercussion samples will make your track stand out from the rest. Interesting percussion samples easily spice up any boring trap beat. You can use multiple percussion hits at different velocities to add some uniqueness to your sound. Percussions can also be used to create transitions and fills in your beat, although that technique is quite common among producers. We will be using a cowbell for our percussion requirements. Certain perc sounds like cowbells can be tuned to the key of our beat. We will program our cowbell hits first by dragging our samples into an empty audio track and then inserting a tuner on the same channel. Now when we play our cowbell, the note will show up on the tuner. Then we can use the clip transposition setting to set the pitch correctly. For our project we will tune the cowbell to an E note. Look at the image provided below for reference.6. The Full BeatOnce you have programmed the individual parts you can go in and make some fine tweaks. You can also add some processing. We will be grouping our drums to keep the arrangement view organised.As you can see in the image above, we have added a drum buss on our Drums group to add some harmonic excitement and punchiness to the beat as a whole. This adds some similar characteristics to every sound in the groove, giving them a similar colour. It is very important to be very moderate with your processing at this stage. We can fine tune the settings once we have finished the whole beat, then we will have a context for our drums should sound.Watch this space for Part 2 and 3, where we will go over the bass and melody programming for a trap beat. We will also upload the whole project (Ableton Live Set) as a free download, once all three parts are uploaded.If you want to follow along with our Ableton project file, then click on the link provided below to download the .alp file:Crypto Cipher Academy_Melodic Trap Beat Tutorial (Ableton Project Download) Close How To Make A Lofi Hip Hop Beat: 6 Easy Steps Lofi Hip Hop Beat Steps:Lo-Fi is a type of music where imperfections are introduced into the audio signal deliberately to achieve texture or character. Lo-Fi is an abbreviation for Low Fidelity, so music producers often employ plugins that artificially degrade the audio to give their sound a vinyl quality. In this article we will explore 6 easy steps to compose a lo-fi hip hop beat.Step 1: Creating the right Chord ProgressionLofi chords are a huge part of their sonic quality. Most loft producers sample old jazz and soul records to create a nostalgic feeling. We will be creating our own progression from scratch and then we will sample ourselves. Lofi hiphop can be anywhere from from 70-100 BPM, sometimes even slower than that. The BPM for our project will be 75 BPM. For sound selection, try to remember what type of instruments old jazz and soul records would use. Using those sounds to create our sample will help us create a more old timey vibe.Look at the chords that we have drawn in the image above. We are using a rhoads preset to create these chords. You can use an acoustic guitar or any other instrument but the way you create your chords will change according to that instrument. Here we are using the chords Em7 - Am7 - CM7 - GM7 for the first four bars, in the second four bar cycle, we are substituting Em7 with Emadd9. You can experiment with the added notes on these chords, also use vinyl or modulation fx on the channel to make things sound more aged.We are using the phaser-flanger device of ableton, as shown in the picture above, to modulate our Rhoads sound.Step 2: Turning Your Chord Progression Into a SampleOnce you are happy with how your chords are sounding, freeze and flatten them to convert into audio. There are a few ways we can sample this. You can do manual edits in your Daw to create MPC like chops.In the image above, you can see that we have made quite a few edits to our original sample after freezing and flattening. Have your metronome on for this section as it will help you to flesh out interesting patterns. We are also applying crossfades at clip edges to prevent any clicks and pops. Alternatively, you can add your freeze and flattened sample into a simpler and use the slicing mode to create patterns using midi.In the image above, we have added our sample into a slicer and then turned on Slicing Mode. You can play around with the sensitivity and slice by settings for different sets of chops. You can now program you sampled melody using midi.These are the notes we drew in with our piano roll for the simpler. We are going to use this as a variation on the main melody.Step 3: Drums that sound oldThe tone of your drum samples play a huge role in lofi hiphop. The drum programming itself is fairly simple. Go for drum sounds with some audible background noise, You can use some processing to lessen the high frequency response of your drum sounds. We also like to add distortion to our drums to make them sound more crunchy. Once you have your drum sounds selected you can arrange them directly on the track according to our grid, but we will use a drum rack. We are using a kick, snare and hit for our beat.This is the pattern we have created, shown in the image above. Do not forget to vary the velocities of your hits as required. You can also use some saturation on the drums to fatten them up and add some more character to the sound. You can also experiment with different grooves on your drums, which will offset our midi from the grid, giving the beat more human touch.We are processing our drums using Ableton's drum buss to add more harmonics and punch to our track.Step 4: Creating a Groovy BasslineBassline in this genre of music is very different from one song to another. Tonally the bass sounds mellow and has much rhythmic variation built into it. Select a preset that has a solid low end with some subtle harmonies in the mids. For the notes in your bassline, you can follow the root notes of the chord, and then develop it further from there. We like to use a lot of octaves and melodic runs to keep things interesting.As you can see, we have added our bass notes along with some melodic and rhythmic variations. Do not forget to add some processing to your bass if it is too quiet in the mix even when the volume is unchanged. We are using a saturator on our bass channel with the settings shown in the image below.Step 5: Adding Fx and FoleyTextures are a major part of Lofi sound. The signature vinyl crackle is present on every track to give the listener the perception, that the song is being played from a vinyl record player. We are using a little bit of vinyl distortion on our main sample to simulate the vinyl crackle (image below).You can also layer your sounds with foley to create more texture along with the vinyl crackle.As you can see in the image above, the drums that have been programmed with midi is being layered with different foley samples to add depth and character to our drums. Vocal chops and one-shots also spice up your beat in a major way, making it more memorable for the listener. You can sprinkle in some more details with risers and down lifters for transition sections.As you can see in the image above we added an impact sample and a white noise riser sample for our project. The impacts are placed at the beginning of every 8 bars, while the risers are placed at the 7th bar and 15th bar with varied lengths.Step 6: Mixing Your BeatMixing a lofi beat is fairly easy. Make sure to balance your faders first and then you can experiment with the pan pot. As long as your sound is well balanced in terms of levels and stereo image, you are halfway there. Kicks and Snares need to be able to punch through the mix. Keep the drums as dynamic as possible. Your bass would also be mixed rather loud in the mix. Other instruments and synths can be balanced according to your taste. EQ out any undesirable low frequencies to make space for your bass sound. Getting rid of the lows in your hiatus, cymbals, fx and instruments, will also reduce muddiness of the overall mix. Sidechain compression is also used in this genre often as an aesthetic tool rather than a tool for mixing. You can sidechain various instruments to your kick and exaggerate the sidechain effect to emphasise on the lofi character of your track.As you can see in the two images provided above, the side chain settings on my melody sidechain and bass sidechain are different. The melody sidechain has more exaggerated and audible sidechain compression happening to create movement in the sound, while the bass side chain is much more focused on attenuating our bass sound whenever the kick strikes without being necessarily heard. You can also experiment with some subtle saturation or soft clipping on you master buss to further drive in that lofi feel of your track.If you want to follow along with our Ableton project file, then click on the link provided below to download the .alp file:Crypto Cipher Academy_Lofi Beat Tutorial (Ableton Project Download) Close Creative Automation Tips And Tricks For A Better Mix All DAWs, no matter how basic, implement some form of automation. Automation means having a computer take control of a parameter within a DAW and change it's value over a period of time set by the user. Automation can refer to the turning of a knob, the sliding of a fader and the toggling of switches within our audio workstation. To carry out any form of Automation the user draws automation curves in the DAW timeline (commonly in an automation lane) which defines the movement of the selected parameter for a certain duration defined by the user. In this article we will explore some creative automation tricks and tips that will improve your mixes.1. Creating Variations For Programmed InstrumentsThere are countless advantages of using MIDI, but one of the areas where this technology fails to deliver is in the realm of humanization. A programmed instrument most likely would have all notes playing in the same velocity, with the same articulation. A real instrument played by a person would naturally have a lot of variations in dynamics and articulations. The same can be done for MIDI instruments but the process often takes a lot of time and patience. Automations can be a great tool to create these variations quickly and efficiently. Automating the volume of a hi hat for example can help make it sound more natural, letting some hits be louder than others, similar to accents performed by a drummer. The pitch can also be automated to simulate articulations like vibrato and pitch bends. The pitch can also be automated in cents for instruments like drums to simulate the drum stick striking different regions of the drum skin. These techniques can add a lot of expression and dynamics to robotic MIDI sections.2. Automating The Volume FaderAutomating the volume fader is one of the most common mixing techniques used by music producers. It is often referred to as "riding the fader", which means to correct the dynamics of a performance in realtime using the console channel strip fader. This technique is widely used to correct the dynamics of vocal performances, where the music producer would use the channel fader to duck or raise certain words, phrases and sections of a performance to add more expression. This technique is also used on live drum recordings, apart from vocals. An example would be, when the drummer plays a lot of ghost notes on the snare, there might be parts of the song where the ghost notes need to be quieter or louder in the mix. The music producer would simply automate the volume fader in a way that the accented snare hits are louder in the mix and the ghost notes are quiter in certain sections and in others where the range is reduced. This technique can also be used to create volume swells at transitional sections of the song which can help to break the monotony. Swells are quite common in genres like EDM and Hip Hop because it adds a motion to otherwise robotic sounding programmed beats. You can also automate the faders of a mix bus or the master bus itself to create dynamics within the mix, having the intro and bridge played at a lower level that the verse and choruses bringing it closer to an actual live performance.3. Varying The Stereo Image Or Stereo Placement Of A Sound In The MixVariations in the stereo field can add a lot of expression to any song. Having some stereo width in the chorus sections creates contrast from the verses of a song, making the chorus stand out. Automating the pan parameter of any track would vary the stereo placement of the sound. Panning helps us to create space in the centre and reduce masking. If we have instruments that have been double tracked, then panning can be used to vary the stereo width of an instrument as well. One common technique to make choruses stand out, is to widen the double tracked instruments with in the mix like guitars and backing vocals. For example if you have vocal double panned at 50% in the verse, perhaps you can change it to 75% for the chorus, making the vocals sound bigger in the mix. Another common panning technique often used in fills and transitions is to have a sound start playing mostly on one side and by the end of the section it slowly moves to the other side. You can achieve this by panning thing like hi hat and snare rolls from left to right or vice versa. If you want to automate the stereo image of multiple tracks together, then you can add then to a buss and use a stereo imager plugin to automate it's width. For individual instruments panning automations an also be achieved through plugins like Autopan in Ableton Live.4. Automating Reverb And Delay   Reverb and delay are two of thew most common audio effects used while mixing. But, overusing them can lead to loss of clarity. A bit of automation can clean up these problems with ease. Using a separate bus for the Reverb, we can automate the send level of the channel where the reverb is required. This gives us the option to manually reduce the send level at the beginning of a signal, therefore bypassing any leftover reverb tail from the previous signal in the channel. This is very common in vocals where the sends can be raised at the end of phrase to fill silences or gaps in the performances, similarly we can also bring the reverb send level down for a busier section of the performance where more clarity is required. Similar techniques are used for delays as well known as "delay throws", where a delay in added to a bus with a quarter note or eighth note setting. The delay send can be raised for particular words and phrases which would ring out in the mix for a longer time. This is a great way to fill empty spaces in a performance, add some ear candy to the mix and also hold the audience attention during the quieter sections of a track. When using reverbs and delays in this way it is common to have the timing synced to the project tempo.5. Automating the Tempo Any live performance will have lots of tempo variations. It is only natural for musicians to play quieter sections of a song at a slower tempo, in relation to the the louder parts of the song that tend to increase in tempo as the volume level increases. This change in tempo will be missing for songs composed within a DAW for obvious reasons. Most DAWs give their user the ability to automate project tempo. This feature is useful to make a studio recording feel more like a live performance. The tempo can be lowered during the intro and outro sections while during the choruses the tempo can be increased to give the feeling of a rise in intensity. It is recommended that the tempo automations are gradual and have a diminished range. Drastic tempo changes are only used if that is the intended effect. In case of a live performance the change in tempo is a natural consequence of the situation, hence it is not intentional. Keeping the tempo changes mild will emulate this phenomenon much better in the context of a mix.ConclusionAutomations have a huge impact on how an audience perceives a recorded track. By implementing the aforementioned tips your mixes will feel more lifelike than robotic. If automations are done well, then the listening experience transports the listener into an environment where it feels like the song is being performed live in front of them. The tips and tricks mentioned in this article are the basics for any music producer who is just starting out. Feel free to experiment and look for more creative ways in which automations can be used to make your mixes sound more natural. Close Creative Drum And Percussion Sound Design With Ableton Simpler Creative Drum And Percussion Sound DesignAbleton Live has a lot of tools for creative sound design. In this article we will explore an interesting technique to create your own unique percussion samples from scratch using any sample of your choice. This technique is extremely simple and effective for cooking up new perks quickly removing any need for incessant sample pack diving. We will be using Ableton's simpler for the main sound design aided with some audio effects.Selecting the SampleTheoretically you can use any sample you want but we will make the most out of this technique if we use loops or long samples that varies over time and has a lot of textures. Fx Loops are a great choice, so are vocal and bass loops. We have chosen the Acid Birds Ambience Fx loop from the Drive and Glow pack that comes with Ableton Live 11 Suite.Processing the Sample with Ableton SimplerCreate a Midi track and then add your simpler from the Instruments section of the browser. Add the sample into the simpler.Now set the start and end points of the Simpler in the correct position to cut to any silence in the beginning or end of the sample and then crop it from the context menu.Turn the LOOP on and adjust the loop Start control to your liking by scanning the waveform. Also reduce the loop Length control to about 0.10%. Any value ranging from 0.5% to 0.10% will work the best.We will create a Midi Clip in our Simpler track and add in some notes. I am using a C2 note. Feel free to use your ears and choose a note according to your liking. I have also changed the velocity of these notes using the clip Randomize control. This step will help us audition our percussion sounds easier.We will shift over to the Controls tab of our Simpler and adjust the Amplitude Envelope. As you can see in the image below I have dropped the Sustain completely and drastically reduced the Decay and Release. Play around with the Decay control to fine tune the timbre of the click sound we have created. I have also dropped the Transpose down to -42st which will help us create some toms and kick drum type samples.We will also adjust the pitch envelope to make it sound more like a percussion. I have set my envelope Amount to +32st. I have also altered the pitch ADSR. I have set Attack at 0.00ms, Decay at 90.6ms, Sustain at 0.0% and Release at 6.00ms. You can adjust the Decay and Amount controls to fine tune the snappy perc sound we have created.Adding Some Fx Processing for TextureOur percussion samples will really start taking shape from this point onwards. Add an Amp after you Simpler. I have selected the Lead setting on my Amp and adjusted my Gain and Dry/Wet controls. You can look at the image below for a reference. The Rock, Lead and Heavy setting work very well. The Amp provides a woody texture to our percussion.I have also added an Overdrive after the Amp. The Overdrive also provides a lot of low mids to beef up our perc. I am putting the Overdrive around 107Hz with Tone at 35% and Dynamics at 25%. You can adjust the parameters as you like. You can create a wide range of sounds just by using these two effects.We will process our sound further by adding some waveshaping. We will insert a Saturation effect in our Fx chain and select the Waveshaper setting from the drop down menu.As you can see in the image above we have adjusted our Drive and Waveshaper controls according to our taste and then adjusted the Dry/Wet. If your sample is clipping a bit then turn on the Soft Clip option. The Saturator adds some character and harmonic richness to our sample.Adding a Filter Envelope in the SimplerNow is a good time to go back to the Simpler and add some filtration. You can go through the various filter modes and add some filter drive for some added texture. Also adjust the Filter Envelope according to preference. I like to set my filter cutoff Frequency at a lower value and the Filter Envelope amount at a moderately high value. I have also adjusted the Decay control which has an interesting effect on our percussion sound.Adding Some Creative Fx Processing to Further Enhance Our SampleThe Erosion audio effect is an extremely handy addition for any percussion sound design. I am using the Noise setting to add some character and fill up the harmonic spectrum of the sound.Another underrated effect for drum sound design is the Corpus Audio Effect. It is a physical modelling tool that imitates the sound of different objects being struck. Here we have chosen the membrane option from the drop down menu to mimic an actual percussive instrument. You can use the image above as a reference point. Play around with the settings because there is no fixed rule here other than keeping the Decay at lower value. The Bleed control also adds some interesting textures.At this point you should have a realistic woody sounding percussion sample that is completely unique and made from scratch.Adding Some Final TouchesAs a last step to our sound design, I like to group everything into an Instrument Rack. If you look at the image below then you will see that I have also mapped Simpler Decay and loop Start controls to Macro 1 and Macro 2 respectively. This technique really shines at this step because now we can adjust our loop Start macro (S Start in the image) and create huge variation of different percussion sounds. We had chosen the initial sample because it had a lot of variation over time. Playing around with the Start will play different parts of the whole sample, creating different sounds and textures. You can also adjust the decay to create different characteristics in your percussion.Feel free to map other controls to the macros. Pitch Envelope Amount and Decay controls are also useful as macros. You can look at the image below for a reference of all the different macros you can map. After you are done, you can save the preset. You can recall this preset at different projects and replace the sample inside the simpler to come up with new percussion sounds.Please download this preset and a bonus sample pack with one shot samples created using this preset for free from the Downloads section of our website or visit the link given below. Download Link: Click Here Close 4 Types of Audio Compressors You Should Be Using Choosing the right compressor for the right job can become confusing for a mix engineer who is starting out. Perhaps a basic understanding of the various types of compression that are commonly used and how they affect our sound can help you decide better. Analog Compressors are classified into 4 main types which have their own sub-categories, but in this article we will focus on the ones that are important for our understanding and how we can use that knowledge to get better mixes or invest in the correct plugin. Even stock plugins that come bundled with your DAW model these 4 main types in some form or the other.1. VCA CompressorThis type of compression is extremely common. The term VCA stands for Voltage Controlled Amplifier. This amplifier is housed in an Integrated Circuit (IC chip) on the compressor circuitry. This IC helps us in fine-tuning various aspects of the compression without introducing any colouration (for the most part). A VCA compressor will have knobs for controlling Attack, Release, Threshold, Ratio and Knee parameters, which makes dialling in the correct amount of gain reduction very easy. VCA compressors are extremely flexible. They are used both in mastering and mixing and sound good on various instruments, vocals and percussion. The fast attack and release times that are achievable on these compressors, can be used to control quick transients. The SSL G Series is an example of a VCA compressor used in many studios. If you look in your DAW, you will find a version of VCA compressor in your stock plugins (eg. Ableton's stock has a Glue Compressor which emulates the SSL G Series VCA compressor and Logic's stock compressor has three different VCA compressor characteristics packed in a single plugin while FL Studio has their own Fruity Compressor with a variable type setting which basically controls the Knee). 2. Optical or Opto CompressorOptical Compressors use a light sensitive resistor and a light source (like an LED) to determine the level of gain reduction on a signal. The incoming signal and its level feeds the light source which increases or decreases in intensity according to the level of the input signal. The light sensitive resistor detects these fluctuations and informs the compressor circuit to apply a certain amount of gain reduction in a certain amount of time. The communication between the light source and the resistor takes longer than a VCA compressor leading to delayed attack times. Furthermore the release of an Opto compressor is logarithmic in nature meaning the greater the signal the faster the release (eg. the release time for first few dBs of gain reduction will be higher than the last ones). Optical compressors are said to be smooth sounding for this particular reason and is often used to round out certain vocals or lead melodies that will  lose their dynamic characteristics with aggressive compression. Generally these compressors don't have an attack or release time control (exceptions do exist in this regard) because of the way they are designed. The Teletronix LA-2A is an example of a well-known hardware Opto Compressor that has numerous plugin emulations.  You can find stock Opto compressors in your DAW itself. For Ableton users you can use your stock compressor plugin in RMS setting to make it act like an optical compressor while Logic's stock compressor has dedicated Opto mode.3. Tube or Mu CompressorTube compressors are also called Vari-Mu or Delta-Mu, depending on the manufacturer. Like the name suggests, these compressors have tubes in their circuitry, that reduce gain depending on the amount of signal fed to the device. Unlike the LA-2A which employs tubes for colouration, in a Mu compressor the tube acts as the main component driving the gain reduction. As the input level increases in these compressors, the current sent to the compressor tube decreases, leading to a decrease in the overall signal level. Tube compressors add a lot of colouration to the signal while levelling it out smoothly. These sound good on mix busses and are also used to glue different tracks together. Most often Mu compressors have the least number of controls and a lot of times they don't even have a control for ratio. The Fairchild 670 and Manley Vari-Mu are two renowned vintage tube compressors. The Klanghelm MJUC jr. is a free tube compressor plugin that you can download and use in your DAW. Stock compressors usually don't have good tube compressor emulations.4. FET CompressorFET compressors are capable of incredibly fast Attack times while adding some colouration to the affected signal. FET stands for Field Effect Transistor which became popular as an alternative to Tube Compressors that had very slow attack times. FETs are less flexible than VCA and Opto compressors because of their tendency to create additional harmonics on compression. They are generally not used on master busses, but they sound very punchy and robust on individual instruments like drums and guitars. They can also add a lot of punch and character to instrument busses, as a result they are used quite a lot while mixing. In a FET compressor the signal being compressed is already affected by the internal circuit of the compressor, which results in a smoother output that is also predictable. Opto and Mu compressors are also smooth but they are not  predictable, while a VCA cannot achieve as fast attack times as a FET. The UREI 1176 is an example of a FET compressor widely used in studios across the world. Some DAWs have FET compressors in their stock bundles (eg. Logic's Stock Compressor has two FET modes), but in case yours doesn't, the Analog Obsession FETISH is a free plugin emulation of the 1176 that you can download and use.Final ThoughtsNo matter what type of compressor you use, the quality of the sound is what matters the most to the listener at the end of the day. At the same time, efficiency is an important part of being a successful mix engineer. If you have a vocal that has a few words and phrases sung in quieter tone relative to the rest of the song, we can use the information to our advantage and pull up an optical compressor to level things out without wasting much time. Similarly if you have make two guitar layers sound more related to each other then a tube compressor can add some glue and similar colouration to both the layers so they work better together. This knowledge should help you in making decisions quicker when it comes to picking the right plugin or hardware for a specific job. Close An Introduction To Commonly Used Equalizers For Mixing and Mastering Equalizers are among the most commonly used plugins in mixing and mastering tasks. Equalizers can be used for tone shaping, controlling problem areas in the frequency spectrum and enhancing certain frequencies to add presence. Equalizers have different filters that can attenuate or boost different parts of the frequency spectrum. In this article, we are going to take a look at the different types of Equalizers used in music production.1. Parametric EQParametric equalizers have multiple filters that can be assigned to different frequency bands. We can then work on these frequencies using the filter's gain and bandwidth (Q. Factor) control.A parametric EQ contains various filter types. Let us get accustomed to them first:a. Low Cut Filter (Highpass)A low cut filter (shown in the image above) removes all frequencies below a set frequency also known as the cutoff. We can use this filter type to remove undesirable low frequencies on an instrument that might not require it, like a hi hat or a cymbal. You can adjust the dB/Octave curve on your EQ to roll off the lower frequencies gently, perhaps for processing a vocal performance. In the image below we are using a 12dB/Octave rolloff curve for our low cut filter.b. Low Shelf FilterA low shelf filter can boost or attenuate all frequencies below a set frequency. They are used for situations where we need to preserve the low frequency information but lower their presence in the sound by a certain amount. This amount is set by the gain control.c. High Cut Filter (Lowpass)A high cut filter removes all frequencies above a set frequency. Like our low cut filter we can also control our dB/Octave curve to control the character of high roll off. You can also use your resonance/bandwidth/Q control to boost or attenuate the cutoff point, for further tonal control. Lowpass filters are used to remove unwanted high frequencies from a sound. d. High Shelf FilterA high shelf filter boosts or attenuates all frequencies above a set cut off point. It is used is situations where the highs do not need to be removed, perhaps to preserve the character of the sound but they need to be lower in the mix.e. Notch FilterNotch filters attenuate a variable bandwidth of frequencies around a set frequency. We can control the bandwidth of the attenuation with the Q control. Notch filter are used for tone shaping and modulation effects (by automating the frequency control).f. Peaking FilterThe peaking filter can attenuate or boost a range of frequencies around a set frequency. We can use the Q control to adjust our bandwidth and then the gain control to dial in the desired amount of attenuation or boost. Peaking Filters are very flexible they are used to boost or attenuate a broad range of frequencies with a low Q value. We can also remove harsh frequencies in the highs with a high Q value.Parametric Equalizers can be both digital or analog. Most DAWs come with their stock parametric EQ. You can also fuse third party parametric Equalizers like FabFilter Pro-Q3. Analog parametric Equalizers are more expensive hardware although they have various plugin emulations that are relatively less expensive. The SSL G EQ is popular parametric EQ both in its hardware and plugin emulation forms.2. Graphic EqualizersGraphic Equalizers are a collection of frequency bands that have a fixed Q value. All the frequency bands have a bell curve on them. There are various types of graphic Equalizers like 31-band, 15-band and 10-band. 31 band Graphic EQs are the most flexible since they offer three bands per octave. Each bands gain can be adjusted by 12-15 dB depending on the model. Engineers often employ multiple bands together on Graphic Equalizers to create shelving curves. These Equalizers are used often for live performances to attenuate problematic frequencies. They are also present on various amplifiers and mixers to give tone shaping option to the user. The API 560 is a popular 10 band graphic Equalizers often seen in studios.3. Linear Phase EqualizersTraditional EQs introduce a a phase change in the signal by a small amount. These phase changes or smears as they are referred to, can cause audible artefacts and colouration which might not be desirable in certain situations. Normal Equalizers introduce minimum amount of phase and they sound good for the most part. In certain mastering situation and instrument recording correction, linear phase Equalizers can come in handy because they will not introduce any coloration induced from phase changes. They create a more natural sounding tone. However, linear phase Equalizers can introduce a lot of latency and CPU load, as a result they cannot be used while recording or mixing large projects. Linear phase Equalizers can introduce distortion to your signal that sound like ringing. This artefact is often not audible but a lot of picky producers like to avoid them for the most part. The Voxengo Marvel GEQ is a linear phase graphic Equalizers that you can download and use in your DAW for free.4. Dynamic EqualizersDynamic Equalizers are a combination of an EQ and a compressor. A traditional EQ reacts and affects the incoming audio signal at all times when the track is being played. Dynamic Equalizers on the other hand react to the internal audio source or a sidechain/external input source. We can set a threshold level for a certain band and the incoming signal that exceeds this level will either be boosted or attenuated. Dynamic Equalizers also provide controls that are found on compressors, such as attack and release. The TDR Nova is a free dynamic Equalizers that you can use in your DAW. FabFilter Pro-Q3 and Izotope Ozone Dynamic EQ are both good options for paid plugins. These Equalizers are used a lot for processing dynamic performances on instruments like drums, guitars and vocals. They are also used to create separation between two competing sounds.

Close JORG HUTTNER I’m trying out Crypto Cipher sample libraries which I really like, They are really great sounding and super useful in various productions and they have simple but really useful interface that they did in Kontakt and my favourite here I’m using in this particular track is Tongue Drum, Swarmandal and Tabla which I really like. Pretty much all the stuff is really useful and can be greatly used in variety of productions and I’m pretty sure you ll have as much fun as I do with these libraries. So, go ahead and check them out. They are really worth it. Close NAINITA DESAI Crypto Cipher is using great Indian talent from all over the country, There is no other company out there which is doing quite what you do. So, please keep up the good work in producing more unusual libraries that are so inspiring to us, Film & Television Composers specially out here in the West. Close John Swihart I’m Sitting with some Crypto Cipher Samples. I’m really loving these new libraries, they have a awesome Tabla which is very playable, Swarmandal sounds amazing. It's just beautiful sound and Dholak is amazing, Loops are great. I’m just loving working with them. They come with great options. I’m very happy with them and I hope you enjoy them too. Close B.T Absolutely freaking out on these sample libraries. If you ‘re looking for unusual kontakt libraries. check www.cryptocipher.in Close SHANKAR TUCKER Good Job Crypto Cipher, Please keep making cool libraries specially loop libraries at the level of quality that you used for Dholak Loops and I’m definitely be getting the next one. Close SANCHIT BALHARA Crypto Cipher is doing really really a god job in bringing the revolution at world level and I wish them all the best. Close MICHAEL MAAS Crypto Cipher is a really great company. In 2014, I had to record and organise a World music album for production music library in France. It contained several live solo performances from all over the World ( Asia , Africa, Middle East & India ). For 3 tracks we needed “Live Sitar” recordings from a real, Indian “Gifted Sitar Player”. I hired Crypto Cipher for the recordings directly from India and the guys did their jib really great. I never imagined a sound quality and performance as we were given by crypto Cipher. I highly recommend the company services and plugins. Close TIM JOHNSON Crypto Cipher Action Walkthrough Video by Tim Johnson Close Pete Lockett Its quite versatile set of Instruments , Definitely worth checking out Crypto Cipher . I’m sure they got new stuff coming soon as well . I’m gonna bring in my some of my own productions with these libraries. Close ADRIANO CLEMENTE One thing I never get tired of reminding to student’s is the idea of trying to get out of your set of tools and set of sounds.Its really interesting to see what type of solution people can come out with these libraries. Close Laurent Zillani Its a great collection of Indian Instruments and Sound Design. I particularly like Solo Tabla and Solo Dholak , Which I think are beautifully recorded and give you lot of options. Close K.J. Singh Team at Crypto Cipher has taken great pains to record some high quality sounds and they have got very talented musicians to play these instruments and some deep programming has gone into making these instruments playable and sound as authentic as possible. Close David Buckley I love the samples from the crypto cipher. They have been recorded and programmed with such care and attention to detail. They stand in a different league to most other ethnic sample libraries as they offer something authentic. Whenever I delve into music from India, or many other places for that matter, I instinctively start clicking in the crypto cipher folder to see what treasures can be added to my music.
