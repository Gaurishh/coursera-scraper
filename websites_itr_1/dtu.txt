Nodal Centre of Excellence in Energy Transition (NCEET) Home About Us Mission & Vision Core Team Members Core Deliverable Activities MoUs Research Project Activities Division Archive NODAL CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY TRANSITION (NCEET) 2070 Net Zero Target Year 5 Divisions 2 MoUs Nodal Centre of Excellence in Energy Transition has been approved in the 51st BOM meeting of DTU. The transition to Clean Energy is critical to creating a sustainable future. Demographic change, urbanization, glocalization, environmental changes, resource efficiency and digitization are presenting new challenges every day. It is therefore, Energy Transition is envisioned to tread on the pathways to net zero riding on clean energy sources with smart and intelligent technologies. About NCEET The commitment of net zero by 2070 despite of foreseeing that the energy demand is set to get double calls for immediate attention towards decarbonization of Power System and Industrial sector besides transport sector. The requisite decarbonization can only be achieved by increasing the penetration of clean energy sources, viz, Solar, Wind, Hydro and Nuclear power generation, besides significant presence of energy storage systems, which will be critical in alleviating the intermittency of the renewable energy sources. Both short term duration (Battery, Pump Storage, Gravity) and long duration energy storage (Pump Storage + H2 storage) systems will play a vital role in stabilizing the grid. The decarbonization of industrial sector will tread different path ways depending on technical feasibility, economics, and scalability. Steel sector may use Green Hydrogen (GH2) based direct reduction of Iron, renewable energy sources and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS); Fertilizer and cement industries will work on GH2 and CCUS, indicating great opportunity for development of technologies around GH2 and CCUS. The transport sector on the other hand will witness integrated approach towards decarbonization, based on Green Fuels (GH2) with Hydrogen Internal Combustion engine (H2-ICE), low carbon power trans (Battery Electric Vehicle, Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle) with omnipresent charging infrastructure, battery swapping, and recycling besides innovative urban planning which includes integrated transport and spatial planning, logistic optimization, travel demand management for reducing the need for travel distance and modal shift from private vehicle to public/shared mode of transport. Such efforts shall demand cutting edge technology development, skilled workforce and stray knowledge base to support domestic manufacturing ecosystem across renewable energy, GH2 productions, power electronics converters and automation, advanced battery technologies, smart pumped hydro system, small modular nuclear reactors, smart interconnected distribution system, H2 storage systems, CCUS technologies, and state of the art technologies for reinforcement of grid infrastructure, building cooling systems, nanostructured surface engineering, etc. The goal for achieving net zero shall fall apart if the technological development does not take cognizance of energy efficiency. Thus, Centre of Excellence in Energy Transition housed in primer engineering institutes/Universities shall be indispensable for driving the need of Energy Transition in our country. DTU envisions to foster cutting edge technologies and driving academic industrial synergies for shaping up future energy landscape for sustainable future. Nodal Centre of Excellence in Energy Transition (NCEET) is established to harbour trailblazing innovations, research and development, culminating into cutting edge technologies to support domestic manufacturing. It will promote innovative, efficient, cost effective and sustainable energy solutions through global networking and synergizing links with industry and Government, besides shaping the future energy policies for uninterrupted process of energy transition at speed and scale, enabling collaborating ecosystem to accelerate the process. NCEET is committed to creation of knowledge base and leveraging it for sustainability in the interest of humanity and arresting climate change. Every possible efforts will be drawn for developing highly skilled manpower for putting the pioneering technologies into practice, re-skilling the engaged manpower and promote capacity building for undeterred energy transition. Prospective MoUs of NCEET For achieving its goals NCEET has entered into MoU with Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and Grid India Ltd, and is process of having MoU with: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, NISE, NIWE Bureau of Energy Efficiency Department of Science & Technology, Department of Scientific & Industrial Research Ministry of Electronics & IT Ministry of Heavy Industries Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises TATA Power Delhi Metro Rail Corporation DTU has already started working with CEA on operational challenges for the impact of eV Charging Systems/Rooftop PV Systems on the distribution feeders by devising interconnection of feeder system for power flow from energy surplus to energy deficient places and embedding adequate storage system to offer the lacking inertial response. Another domain of investigation hovers around improving inertia and reliability of the grid amidst high penetration of renewables in the grid.
