Home » Educate India Society About Us Founder Members Educate India Society was registered under the Societies Registration Act of 1860 on 16 June 1995. To promote excellence in technical and management education, The NorthCap University (NCU), formerly ITM University, Gurugram, was founded in 1996 as the Institute of Technology and Management, Gurgaon, by Educate India Society and affiliated to Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. Educate India Society was registered under the Societies Registration Act of 1860 on 16th June 1995. The institute was conceived as Institute of Technology and Management in response to the acute deficiency of centres of higher learning in the country, and also to address the need of developing relevant human capital, and lastly to meet the technological and management-level challenges of the 21st century. The founders had a clear and well-defined mission - to build an unaided self-financed university committed to delivering education that matches the internationally recognised standards. The vision was to shape a university that would go on to serve an intellectual resource base in Indian subcontinent. The society has aimed from the beginning to make this university the most eminent in the country in order to draw the youth of every state. The institute gained the status of a State private university, called the ITM University, Gurgaon, in the Academic Year 2009-10 under Act No. 25/2009 by an Act of Legislature of Govt. of Haryana and accorded UGC approval under Section 22 of the UGC Act 1956. ITM University, now The NorthCap University, thus became an unaided, self-financed private University in 2010 duly recognised by UGC under section 2(f) and 12(b) of the UGC Act of 1956, and the Bar Council of India and has the right to confer degrees under Section 22(1) of the UGC Act, 1956. The University has been included by UGC and BCI in their select list of approved universities. Founder Members Mr. Avdhesh Mishra Mr. Shiv Saran Mehra Mr. N.K. Dewan Mr. V.
