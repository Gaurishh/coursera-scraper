PreviousI was very confused whether I should go for an MBA. If i didn't get an IIM, then ROI is not good. Kraftshala was offering much better ROI on my time and money. 2 of my friends were already placed in large companies from them. I am now placed at which was a dream company for me!Abhishek NimawatSales Executive trainee, NestlÃ©Ex-Biotech graduateI was a fresher. And in the B2B industry, if you need a job you need to have experience but to have experience you need a job. It's like a vicious cycle and that's what Kraftshalaâs program helped me break. For me, it wasnât just a program, it was rather a series of projects which helped me gain real work experience. I got placed at in a remote role. I don't have any freshers working alongside me. So I am still amazed that I could break in!Deeksha YadavSales Development Representative, BrowserstackFresherI am a Science graduate from 2023 and joined a BPO and I LOVED talking to people. Thats how i realised i want to be in sales and got into Kraftshalaâs program. And what a decision it was! I got placed at where I now take care of a full territory! I am responsible for new business development, managing the team from the DS, to the merchandiser and driving revenue. It is a dream to be here at Nestle and I am enjoying each moment.Kritika YadavSales Executive trainee, NestlÃ©Ex-Subject Matter Expert @Task UsI joined the program to enhance my business knowledge, and it was absolutely worth it. The curriculum is âtoo practical,â taught by professionals working in the industry. The rigorous structure kept me on my toes, and the live projects were a game-changerâcalling 300 real customers, facing rejections, and finally cracking conversions was an unmatched experience. The mentorship, real-world exposure, and placements made this better than an MBA for sure! It was learning by doing, and it changed everything for me!Niyati MadhavaniBusiness Manager - Enterprise Sales, Analytics VidyaEx-Content Writer NextKraftshalaâs PGP in Sales, Marketing and Business LeadershipBuilt on 4 core pillarsKraft /krÉËft/ nounKrafts are skills that help you create value for the world and exponential career growth for yourself.
