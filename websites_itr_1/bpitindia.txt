The unwavering support from professors and fellow students fostered a sense of belonging within our diverse community. Rajat Gupta IT (2019-23) Associate Software Developer (Accenture) My name is Sanidhay Grover, and I graduated from Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology with a degree in B.Tech in Information Technology in 2023. Looking back on my experience, I am filled with gratitude for the incredible journey I had during my undergraduate program. The environment, teaching, and training staff at my college played a pivotal role in shaping my academic journey and setting me on the path to success. I am especially grateful for the support provided by the placement cell, which offered valuable guidance and resources as I navigated the job market. Since graduating, I have embarked on a career as a software developer, where I continue to apply the lessons learned and values instilled during my time at BPIT. This experience has empowered me to pursue my passions, creating secure and efficient software solutions that positively impact businesses and society, and achieve my goals of driving technological progress. To prospective students considering BPIT, I wholeheartedly recommend seizing the opportunity to be part of this dynamic learning community. Sanidhay Grover IT (2019-23) Software Developer RTDS BPIT played a vital role in supporting the students, especially the placement cell which gave us ample amount of opportunities. We were also given extra classes on various topics from soft skills to aptitude, both of which are equally important. I am extremely grateful to BPIT for the exposure that I got from here. I joined the Pepcoding program introduced to us by the placement cell itself. I attended those classes regularly and it helped me become proficient and interview-ready. I started to love solving problems but with this, I also learned development in order to gather good projects for my resume.
