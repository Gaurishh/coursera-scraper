The university represents a harmonious blend of traditional values and contemporary aspirations rooted in nationalism. Its illustrious heritage provides a continuous source of inspiration and will remain a guiding light for both current and future generations.Read More Jamia VisionStrive to foster the goals of building a secular and modern system of integrated education for sustainable development of society and better future for all.Read More Jamia's LogoRight on the top is a star with the inscription“Allah O Akbar.” When in dark nights poor travellers have to traverse jungles and there is no one to show them the way, they chart their course with the help of stars. The star of Allah O Akbar is the guiding star of Jamia. Its eyes are fixed on this star which shows it the path in the darkling world. It reflects the truth that Allah is the greatest and he who bows his head before Him only, discovers the truth. Having bowed before Him, how can the head bow before anything else? Beneath this glittering star is a book with the inscription, Allammal Insaana Maalam Yalam (Taught man that which he knew not). This is the Holy Quran. Through the Holy Quran, Allah has revealed His Will to His differences of caste, class, colour; of master and slave, and became true to His tenets. This book led from darkness to light, and placed the wayward and lost on the Straight Path. The Prophet made an example of his own life. By the light of his eyes and the warmth of his heart, He prepared a group of good persons who cleaned the world of evil and spread the Word of God. On either side of the Book are two date tress typical of the land where God’s last Prophet was born. They are symbolic of the barren valley in which nothing grew; but it was there that the sapling of din took root. These trees are emblems of hope from a land in which not a leaf or flower could sprout; but wherein suddenly the springs of hidaya burst forth and drenched the “communities of the heart”. They are a source of consolation for people who became disheartened with adverse circumstances. Why do external factors make them lose hope? At the very bottom is a tiny silver crescent which reads Jamia Millia Islamia. This crescent is small but just as it expands to become the full moon on the fourteenth night, so also Jamia. Meaning that this is the beginning of our work. It will expand to become the full moon and a source of delight for the eve of its beholder. Written By: Dr. Zakir Husain.Read More Some AlumniAlumni are an institution’s brand ambassadors, carrying their core values of excellence, lifelong learning of inclusiveness and diversity all around the world. The ethos and character of the institutions are expressed into their professional and social life style. Alumni can therefore, play a crucial role not only in spreading the name of the institution but also raise the quality of the institution that they hail from. They can provide sustainability to the parent institutions through both by imparting training in innovative skills to their Alma mater and by extra mural funding which are so necessary for the growth and development of any modern institution. These purposes of the alumni association of JMI shall remain in effect as long as JMI remains organised exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes as per the existing act of the Indian Parliament which granted central university status to JMI.Read More Explore & UpdatesStudy @ JAMIAFaculties, Departments & CentresJamia Millia Islamia offers various academic & research programs through 10 faculties, 44 departments & 30 centres.

However, lasting improvements in standards cannot come about only by accreditation from outside, once in five years. An internal mechanism for sustenance, assurance and enhancement of the quality culture of education imparted by the institution, therefore becomes essential. Many HEIs already have established the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a post accreditation quality sustenance activity. Therefore, in pursuance for performance evaluation, assessment and accreditation and quality up-gradation of institutions of higher education, Jamia Millia Islamia has setup an Internal Quality Assurance cell since 2010. Ever since its establishment the IQAC is actively working towards creating quality conscious environment in the University. Jamia Millia Islamia has been accredited as ‘A’ grade for the first cycle of NAAC accreditation in Feb 2015.

The university represents a harmonious blend of traditional values and contemporary aspirations rooted in nationalism. Its illustrious heritage provides a continuous source of inspiration and will remain a guiding light for both current and future generations.Read More Jamia VisionStrive to foster the goals of building a secular and modern system of integrated education for sustainable development of society and better future for all.Read More Jamia's LogoRight on the top is a star with the inscription“Allah O Akbar.” When in dark nights poor travellers have to traverse jungles and there is no one to show them the way, they chart their course with the help of stars. The star of Allah O Akbar is the guiding star of Jamia. Its eyes are fixed on this star which shows it the path in the darkling world. It reflects the truth that Allah is the greatest and he who bows his head before Him only, discovers the truth. Having bowed before Him, how can the head bow before anything else? Beneath this glittering star is a book with the inscription, Allammal Insaana Maalam Yalam (Taught man that which he knew not). This is the Holy Quran. Through the Holy Quran, Allah has revealed His Will to His differences of caste, class, colour; of master and slave, and became true to His tenets. This book led from darkness to light, and placed the wayward and lost on the Straight Path. The Prophet made an example of his own life. By the light of his eyes and the warmth of his heart, He prepared a group of good persons who cleaned the world of evil and spread the Word of God. On either side of the Book are two date tress typical of the land where God’s last Prophet was born. They are symbolic of the barren valley in which nothing grew; but it was there that the sapling of din took root. These trees are emblems of hope from a land in which not a leaf or flower could sprout; but wherein suddenly the springs of hidaya burst forth and drenched the “communities of the heart”. They are a source of consolation for people who became disheartened with adverse circumstances. Why do external factors make them lose hope? At the very bottom is a tiny silver crescent which reads Jamia Millia Islamia. This crescent is small but just as it expands to become the full moon on the fourteenth night, so also Jamia. Meaning that this is the beginning of our work. It will expand to become the full moon and a source of delight for the eve of its beholder. Written By: Dr. Zakir Husain.Read More Some AlumniAlumni are an institution’s brand ambassadors, carrying their core values of excellence, lifelong learning of inclusiveness and diversity all around the world. The ethos and character of the institutions are expressed into their professional and social life style. Alumni can therefore, play a crucial role not only in spreading the name of the institution but also raise the quality of the institution that they hail from. They can provide sustainability to the parent institutions through both by imparting training in innovative skills to their Alma mater and by extra mural funding which are so necessary for the growth and development of any modern institution. These purposes of the alumni association of JMI shall remain in effect as long as JMI remains organised exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes as per the existing act of the Indian Parliament which granted central university status to JMI.Read More Explore & UpdatesStudy @ JAMIAFaculties, Departments & CentresJamia Millia Islamia offers various academic & research programs through 10 faculties, 44 departments & 30 centres.

However, lasting improvements in standards cannot come about only by accreditation from outside, once in five years. An internal mechanism for sustenance, assurance and enhancement of the quality culture of education imparted by the institution, therefore becomes essential. Many HEIs already have established the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a post accreditation quality sustenance activity. Therefore, in pursuance for performance evaluation, assessment and accreditation and quality up-gradation of institutions of higher education, Jamia Millia Islamia has setup an Internal Quality Assurance cell since 2010. Ever since its establishment the IQAC is actively working towards creating quality conscious environment in the University. Jamia Millia Islamia has been accredited as ‘A’ grade for the first cycle of NAAC accreditation in Feb 2015.
