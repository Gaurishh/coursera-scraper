The subsequent expansion in 2005, to the Bengaluru campus in Marathahalli was a continuation of this dream. Building trust with 44 students in the early days and seeing them go on to achieve success in leading organizations and as entrepreneurs is a testament to the institution's quality and commitment to providing a successful career path. The fact that the institution's intake of students has increased over the years is a sign of its growing reputation and the demand for quality education. It's a remarkable journey from those early days to the present, with many more students benefiting from ISB&M's programs and opportunities. The impact on the professional lives of the students who have passed through the institution is undoubtedly a source of pride for ISB&M. Moving to a larger space in 2009 to the industrial area of Sompura in Dabaspet was a significant development for ISB&M. The decision to relocate to a five-acre land surrounded by over 300 companies, including reputed names like the Minda group, Triveni Engineering, and the Jindal group, speaks to the institution's strategic expansion and the potential for industry collaboration. The presence of these prominent companies in the vicinity can provide students with valuable opportunities for internships, networking, and real-world experience. The fact that the college is fully residential with modern, well-equipped hostels ensures that students have a conducive environment for learning and personal development. Additionally, being well-connected to the city through various modes of transportation, including trains and buses, makes it convenient for students to access the campus and engage with the professional world. This kind of infrastructure and location can certainly enhance the overall educational experience at ISB&M.

Aparajitha Mahaswetha Director - Business Development Amicorp Group Batch 12-14 It was a wonderful experience at ISB&M with an excellent exposure provided through various cells (Placement cell, Alumni Cell etc.). I was placement coordinator for PAC team where members/students were given opportunity to interact with industry experts for Internships/Placements. This way technically, my sales and marketing journey has started before I have passed out with PGDM degree. It is pertinent to mention that; ISB&M gets overall development of student education & practical exposure of corporate/entrepreneur world.
