The following steps are involved in SAFI. These steps have been very well incorporated in the software-generated reports: Completion of the instrument The respondent responds to the items of the instrument, according to given the instructions. Conceptual InputThe respondent reads the short account of the theory underlying the instrument. InterpretationThe respondent then reads his/her sco res and their interpretation, generated by the computer. FeedbackThe respondent then reads the software - generated feedback. Action PlanningThe respondent picks up two or three suggestions given at the end of the report and prepares to implement them for a minimum of two months. ExperimentationThe respondent implements the action plan, keeping note of satisfactory or unsatisfactory experiences. Follow - upThe respondent again responds to the instrument after about 6 months to see significant changes in the scores. SAFI tools are a unique outcome of the wide – ranging contributions made by the HRD Guru, Dr. Udai Pareek, in the field of psychology, applied behavioual sciences and human resources. In the fast changing economic and social scenario, SAFI tools – a set of psychometric instruments, help in understanding various aspects of human behaviour from simple to complex; from individual level to organizational context.The SAFI tools are the only instruments in the world that have highly exhaustive feedback reports (approximately 15 – 20 pages), and most importantly, provide suggestions for improvement. These tools are based on certain concepts and theories and the reports contain all the theories on which the instruments are based, along with the interpretation of the scores. The interpretation is based on norms developed from data of thousands ofrespondents from a large range of organisations. The reports, which are self – explanatory, offer an individual and the organisation an opportunity to discover oneself and start the journey for self – development.These instruments attend to both individual as well as organisational needs. SAFI tools help in gaining better understanding of personal effectiveness, role effectiveness, team effectiveness and organisational effectiveness. The instruments are properly standardisedand extensively researched. These have high reliability and validity.The easy – to – understand instruments and user – friendly technology ensures anywhere anytime access to in-depth interpretation and concrete suggestions to one and all: students, executives, supervisors, managers, organisational leaders, trainers, consultants, salespeople, parents, teachers, counsellors and all those who wish to embark on a journey of growth and development.We welcome you to the world of SAFI.
