We have had strong and growing interest from both recent and veteran IIM alumni to participate in teaching and placement. Lastly, the primary motivation of nearly all IIM alumni is to ensure that FOSTIIMA graduates get access to the intellectual and professional network which has a distinct IIM flavor to it.Jaithirth (Jerry) RaoChairman, Governing BodyFOSTIIMA Business SchoolKey Strength:Amongst top 20 B-schools in India in terms of Education & PlacementsTwo Year Full Time AICTE Approved PGDM ProgramConsistently top ranked Business school in Delhi NCRWorld Class State of Art Infrastructure.Most modern and futuristic course curriculumTotally research driven and case study based delivery methodologyPGDM batch of 2022 - 24 averaging placements above 11.02 lakhs per annumEntire core faculty are IIM GraduatesQuick LinksHomeAboutBlogAcademicsFAQsAICTE Mandatory DisclosureNews & EventsIQACFaculty Innovations in Teaching IMPORTANT LINKSAdmission ProcessFee StructurePlacementFacultyCareersNIRFGrievance & HelplineBalance SheetAbout MARGDARSHAKWEB LINKSFOSTIIMA StrengthLife at FOSTIIMAVision, Mission & PEOsHR Policy 2024-25Faculty FeedbackStudent FeedbackAwards & AccreditationsRefund policy & cancellation policyCONTACT USFOSTIIMA Business School Plot No. HAF-1, Dwarka Sector 9, New Delhi, 110077+91 11 4612 6000 Copyright © 2025 FOSTIIMA Business SchoolDesigned with by GO4DigitalPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsSitemap ×Let's Talk !

There is a need to bridge this gap by bringing a radical change in the management education system to see break through results. This is possible only by changing our age old paradigm and we introduce content along with methods of teaching and learning which make our management education student and industry centered rather than faculty centered. Content of course needs complete re-look so that unwanted content and subjects are removed from the course curriculum and what is needed by the industry is introduced.Most management institutes use Case Study method as a tool to make students understand the theoretical concepts. There is a need to have simulation exercises for students to impart practical knowledge to them while working in a virtual organization. As in engineering institutes we have practical labs, we must have virtual organizations where students work on various situations and find solution to the problems using the theoretical concepts and practical knowledge by faculty having corporate experience.There is a need to encourage students to take up corporate projects while they are still studying so that they are exposed to corporate environment before they pass out and join some organization. To impart practical education to students, institutes must give students platform to interact with industry regularly to get adjusted and mould as per the industry expectations.There is a need to have faculty that has diversified experience including industry, teaching, training, research, counseling, and consultancy. Faculty must encourage innovation and creativity so that students also opt for start-ups and Government projects.Institutes must also inculcate team concept and risk taking capability through practical exercises which is the basic requirement in any corporate environment.Managers so developed and nurtured will definitely contribute to the growth of the industry and the country.I proudly say that we at FBS use all above mentioned tools and techniques to impart quality education to the students as per corporate and the country’s present requirement.Dr. Subhash Kakkar, Director Ph.D. (FMS-DU), MBA (FMS-DU), B.Sc.Engg.
