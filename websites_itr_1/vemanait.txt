Home IQAC About IQAC Vision & Mission Composition Minutes of the Meeting Action Taken Report SSR About IQAC Introduction: "Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection." â Mark Twain Quality Sustenance and Quality Enhancement are the two key principles that resonate within institutions of higher learning today. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) are prominent organizations that assess and accredit institutions to ensure quality in education. These bodies advocate the establishment of an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) to continually improve and maintain educational standards. Vemana Institute of Technology (Vemana IT) conforms to the requirements of students, and society at large by focusing efforts in quality education. Vemana IT is committed to continual improvement of services, processes and resources for effective conformance to the requirements of all the stakeholders. To achieve such commitment, Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) was formulated in 2019 to design, monitor and assess the quality parameters in academic functions of Institute.
