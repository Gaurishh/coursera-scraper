On the contrary, if you are okay with a basic website design and do not have ideation for your website colour theme, UI/UX design, features, and appearance, then the template-based website is the right option for you. While choosing custom website development requires you to expand your budget, if you need a static and less functional website under $600 then choose template-based website development. However, if you can‚Äôt compromise on the design, feel, and functionality, then it is always recommended to opt for Custom website development solutions as they are more systematic, well-planned, and tech-savvy. . Q-4). How to choose a reliable web application development company? Always choose a development company after researching their website thoroughly. Following are considerable things to find a trusted web development partner for your project: The company must have a smoothly functioning website for themselves. Their website must offer complete business details such as Founder details, a list of products and services, and contact details transparently on their website. The company‚Äôs privacy policy must be uploaded on its website and it must offer information like business registration number and registered office address. Always connect over a call with the company before outsourcing the development company. If possible, pay a visit to them and try to analyse their authenticity and expertise by engaging in meaningful communication. Ask them to show you some website samples that they have developed for their clients. The above checklist is sufficient for shortlisting a reliable website development company in India. Q-5).
