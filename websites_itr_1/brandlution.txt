Hewad Niazai Founder “ Frequently Asked Questions FAQs for Search Engine Optimization What is SEO? Search engine optimization commonly known as SEO is the process of increasing the visibility of a website on a search engine’s ranking page/Google organically. The higher the rank on SERP, the frequency of the site’s appearance on the Google page is more, resulting in more traffic to your website. SEO can be used in different forms of searches such as image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search, and more. Why do I need SEO for my business? Search engine optimization is an essential factor of a business’s digital marketing strategy.

Keywords are the most integral part of SEO strategies. They can be used in keyword phrases as well.

The right use of keywords is vital for ranking well and being found on the Internet. How does SEO work if my business is offline? All businesses run on trust. Every business must build trust with your audience even before they become customers. So, what if your business sells offline yet. Even if you have an offline existence, it’s important to have a decent and running website that talks about all your features listed.

How much time do I need to increase my organic traffic with SEO? Brandlusion follows a holistic approach towards achieving the SEO goals set for your business. Every company’s SEO needs are different and so is their audience.

With consistent efforts, and our strategies will help you drive organic traffic through many SEO techniques and tools which typically, takes a duration of 6 months to 1 year. What is the cost of SEO services? This is a very common question we come along through all our clients in the very first meet. And like always we say it depends on client requirements because SEO services are not served as a package to all. One plan fits all is not something that you can expect from SEO. We work with a wide range of businesses and their needs. Every businesses’ requirements, desired results, and budget can vary. Let us give you a fair idea of what are a few factors we consider while calculating the SEO services cost:Size of the website Market competition What’s your website’s current position on SERP What’s the number of keywords you want to target?Your existing digital visibility And most importantly, what’s your budget? What is on-page SEO? On-page SEO refers to strategies applied on or within a page of your website to assist and help the website rank higher in the search engine. On-page SEO includes optimizing content and other factors like image descriptions, keyword optimization, and more. On-page SEO does not include anything that is outside the website. What are SEO backlinks? This is another strategy of SEO service that plays a vital role in optimizing your site, plus building the reliability and relevancy of your website for search engines. Search engines work on a particular system of ranking, indexing helps them determine which page is more relevant to which query. Brandlution works towards quality backlinks for your website that gains a vote of confidence from another site. Why do Search Engine Rankings Change Frequently? While we search for information on the search engine, we observe that a website that stood in third place on day 1 suddenly changes its position to 6th place the very next day. It is frustrating to website owners to see this frequent change. But that’s how search engines work as they are dynamic pages. A keyword that ranked today may not be as important as it was yesterday. Several factors affect the ranking of web pages and it includes a new website, new keywords in the market, fresh content, enhanced SEO practices that boosted some sites’ relevance, backlinks updated, and more.

The Process Of Social Media Optimization Competitor analysis If there’s a company that takes a unique route to chart successful SMO campaigns for a multitude of businesses, it’s Brandlution. It’s important to know how other organizations are performing on social media, and merely posting content by creating social media profiles and sharing information isn’t everything. Analyzing the competition helps you understand what works for your brand and what’s working for others. You can use competitor analysis to rectify the mistakes you’re making and take steps to improve your social media standing. Customer Persona Connect with your audience. A buyer persona is a critical factor that helps businesses understand diverse customer requirements and create a research-based persona of an ideal customer. While it’s practically impossible to satisfy all customers, this fictitious persona will enable brands to meet maximum customer requirements and boost overall satisfaction levels. Every business needs to earn the best loyalty of its clients. Loyal clients are the mainstay of every business and Brandlution understands it. Content Idea Curation The keywords you use to create social media posts and content can critically influence your position on SERPs.

Strategy building is the buzzword that guides your actions and gives you a clear picture of whether you’re succeeding or failing. You can make your plan more specific to suit a particular goal to be more effective. Profile Optimization Creating social media profiles to boost marketing efforts is one thing.

Brandlution offers tailored and comprehensive Social Media Optimization strategies to suit your unique business requirements and assist your brand in delivering results beyond expectations for both, the client and business needs. Content Calendar Preparation Having social media content calendars in place are highly effective to plan and organize your upcoming content without hassles. A content calendar is the backbone of your entire social media marketing strategy, and it can be a simple or complex one with dozens of feeds as per your brand’s requirement. You can save time and post consistently to keep your readers engaged and drive better conversions. A content calendar helps you maintain consistency in delivering the content and keeping in touch with your customers time-on-time. Original Creative Design & Posting Creating original designs by inducing creativity and developing engaging content to post them on social media platforms delivers optimum results and enhanced sales. Likewise, having an eye-catching and original Facebook profile, Twitter background, or creative Instagram profile helps build brand reputation and increase customer loyalty. This also helps you in creating effective promotional campaigns and builds a lasting relationship with your customers, strengthening your brand and increasing the online presence of your business across the globe. Engagement Optimization Reaching customers on social media isn’t only about identifying your target audience and the ideal channel to establish connections, but equally important is the timing and managing of your campaigns. Several key factors help you achieve this, including identifying the demographics and understanding what makes your audience tick. Eventually, customers will show trust in your brand and know that they’ll receive a positive response to their queries increasing customer engagement, further building your online reputation, and increasing sales. Profile Maintenance One of the most important goals of any business using a Social Media Optimization strategy is to create a profile that is catchy and which captures the utmost popularity among the target audience. Keeping your social media profile up to date is a critical factor that decides the impact, success, and growth of your brand among the masses. Since it’s a dynamic platform, your profile can soon become outdated if you don’t update it with new content, engaging and interactive posts, and other inputs that give value to your customers. Social Integration on Website One of the proven tactics to increase potential visitors to your website and boost conversions is to redirect your social media followers to your website. Website social media integration is the process of doing this and enabling your customers to access your social media platforms via your website. While SEO is mandatory for increasing traffic and boosting rankings on SERPs, Social Media also generates more traffic and delivers optimal business results by navigating the traffic to your website.
